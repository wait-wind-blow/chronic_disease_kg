27189863,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease with high global morbidity and mortality. COPD is characterized by poorly reversible airway obstruction, which is confirmed by spirometry, and includes obstruction of the small airways (chronic obstructive bronchiolitis) and emphysema, which lead to air trapping and shortness of breath in response to physical exertion. The most common risk factor for the development of COPD is cigarette smoking, but other environmental factors, such as exposure to indoor air pollutants - especially in developing countries - might influence COPD risk. Not all smokers develop COPD and the reasons for disease susceptibility in these individuals have not been fully elucidated. Although the mechanisms underlying COPD remain poorly understood, the disease is associated with chronic inflammation that is usually corticosteroid resistant. In addition, COPD involves accelerated ageing of the lungs and an abnormal repair mechanism that might be driven by oxidative stress. Acute exacerbations, which are mainly triggered by viral or bacterial infections, are important as they are linked to a poor prognosis. The mainstay of the management of stable disease is the use of inhaled long-acting bronchodilators, whereas corticosteroids are beneficial primarily in patients who have coexisting features of asthma, such as eosinophilic inflammation and more reversibility of airway obstruction. Apart from smoking cessation, no treatments reduce disease progression. More research is needed to better understand disease mechanisms and to develop new treatments that reduce disease activity and progression.",2015,respiratory
37286221,The role of diet and nutrition in the management of COPD.,"In 2014, the European Respiratory Society published a statement on nutritional assessment and therapy in COPD. Since then, increasing research has been performed on the role of diet and nutrition in the prevention and management of COPD. Here, we provide an overview of recent scientific advances and clinical implications. Evidence for a potential role of diet and nutrition as a risk factor in the development of COPD has been accumulating and is reflected in the dietary patterns of patients with COPD. Consuming a healthy diet should, therefore, be promoted in patients with COPD. Distinct COPD phenotypes have been identified incorporating nutritional status, ranging from cachexia and frailty to obesity. The importance of body composition assessment and the need for tailored nutritional screening instruments is further highlighted. Dietary interventions and targeted single or multi-nutrient supplementation can be beneficial when optimal timing is considered. The therapeutic window of opportunity for nutritional interventions during and recovering from an acute exacerbation and hospitalisation is underexplored.",2023,respiratory
32800187,Epidemiology of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects about 300 million people worldwide, resulting in approximately 64 million disability-adjusted life years. Household air pollution affects almost 3 billion people worldwide and is a major risk factor for COPD. An estimated 25% to 45% of patients with COPD worldwide have never smoked. Fourteen percent of the overall COPD burden is attributable to occupational exposures. Rural populations are at higher risk for COPD than urban residents. African American never-smokers have a disproportionately high prevalence and Hispanic people have a low prevalence of COPD.",2020,respiratory
39046133,Small airways disease in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Small airway disease (SAD) represents a common and critical feature of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Introduced in the '60s, SAD has gradually gained increasing interest as assessment methodologies have improved. Chronic exposure to smoking and noxious particles or gases induces inflammation and remodeling, leading to airway obstruction and SAD, eventually resulting in complete airway loss. A literature search up to June 2024 was performed in PubMed to identify articles on SAD and airway diseases mainly COPD, but also to the extent that it seemed relevant in the uncontrolled/severe asthma field, where SAD is better studied. We provide clinicians and translational scientists with a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature on SAD in COPD, concentrating on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic techniques, and current pharmacological approaches targeting airflow obstruction in small airways. Small airways are the primary site for the onset and progression of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, with significant clinical consequences associated with poor lung function, hyperinflation, and impaired quality of life. The early identification of individuals with subclinical SAD may allow us to prevent its further progress from airway loss and potential development of emphysema and choose the appropriate therapeutic approach.",2024,respiratory
34858022,Focus on Early COPD: Definition and Early Lung Development.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease with high incidence rate and mortality rates worldwide. It is the third leading cause of death in the world. Nevertheless, little progress has been made in treating and preventing the disease. Under these circumstances, the concept of ""early COPD"" was proposed. Although this concept is not new, most health-care workers do not fully understand early COPD and tend to confuse it with mild COPD. In this review, we mainly discuss the definition of early COPD and the developmental trajectory of lung function. Although patients with early COPD have no symptoms, their lung function is already lower than that of normal people. A relatively complete definition is needed to identify this group of people. Reduced lung function is the diagnostic criterion for COPD, but lung development is a long-term dynamic process. In addition to smoking and air pollution, we should pay more attention to prenatal and childhood risk factors, for example, parents smoking, birth weight, preterm birth, mode of delivery, childhood respiratory infections and childhood asthma. Health-care workers need to be fully aware of early COPD, to reduce the morbidity of COPD and take effective measures to prevent these risk factors.",2021,respiratory
29731623,Disease burden of COPD in China: a systematic review.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the main contributors to the global burden of disease. The aim of this systematic review was to quantify the disease burden of COPD in China and to determine the risk factors of the disease. The number of studies included in the review was 47 with an average quality assessment score of 7.70 out of 10. Reported COPD prevalence varied between 1.20% and 8.87% in different provinces/cities across China. The prevalence rate of COPD was higher among men (7.76%) than women (4.07%). The disease was more prevalent in rural areas (7.62%) than in urban areas (6.09%). The diagnostic rate of COPD patients in China varied from 23.61% to 30.00%. The percentage of COPD patients receiving outpatient treatment was around 50%, while the admission rate ranged between 8.78% and 35.60%. Tobacco exposure and biomass fuel/solid fuel usage were documented as two important risk factors of COPD. COPD ranked among the top three leading causes of death in China. The direct medical cost of COPD ranged from 72 to 3,565 USD per capita per year, accounting for 33.33% to 118.09% of local average annual income. The most commonly used scales for the assessment of quality of life (QoL) included Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire, Airways Questionnaire 20, SF-36, and their revised versions. The status of QoL was worse among COPD patients than in non-COPD patients, and COPD patients were at higher risks of depression. The COPD burden in China was high in terms of economic burden and QoL. In view of the high smoking rate and considerable concerns related to air pollution and smog in China, countermeasures need to be taken to improve disease prevention and management to reduce disease burdens raised by COPD.",2018,respiratory
39344061,Update on the pharmacological treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common syndrome associated with smoking and environmental exposures coupled with genetic susceptibility. Recent major advancements in the treatment of COPD patients have become available. New data on the role of classic bronchodilators, including short-acting and long-acting beta2-agonists and anti-muscarinic antagonists, in the treatment of COPD patients are discussed. Data promoting a more targeted approach to inhaled and systemic corticosteroid use in COPD are reviewed. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, including the recently approved PDE 3/4 inhibitor inhaled ensifentrine, are noted. Selective use of antibiotics can play a role in complex COPD patients. COPD patients with evidence of asthma-COPD overlap syndrome and type-two lymphocytic inflammatory-mediated airway constriction appear to respond to biologics, particularly the anti-IL-4/IL-3 antagonist monoclonal antibody, dupilumab. New therapeutic options have made the approach and treatment of the COPD patient much more complicated. These options tend to be very expensive. Attention to identifying the endotype and phenotype will help direct the pharmacotherapy.",2024,respiratory
31220055,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Smoking Status - United States, 2017.","Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the United States; however, an estimated one fourth of adults with COPD have never smoked (1). CDC analyzed state-specific Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 2017, which indicated that, overall among U.S. adults, 6.2% (age-adjusted) reported having been told by a health care professional that they had COPD. The age-adjusted prevalence of COPD was 15.2% among current cigarette smokers, 7.6% among former smokers, and 2.8% among adults who had never smoked. Higher prevalences of COPD were observed in southeastern and Appalachian states, regardless of smoking status of respondents. Whereas the strong positive correlation between state prevalence of COPD and state prevalence of current smoking was expected among current and former smokers, a similar relationship among adults who had never smoked suggests secondhand smoke exposure as a potential risk factor for COPD. Continued promotion of smoke-free environments might reduce COPD among both those who smoke and those who do not.",2019,respiratory
40437348,Contemporary Concise Review 2024: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"Non-smoking COPD is common in LMICs, especially in women. Biomass fuel and air pollution are major risk factors with distinct pathophysiology. The 'eosinophilic' endotype in COPD is biologically distinct from asthma. PRISm, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC Z-scores, and quantitative CT improve early COPD detection. Dupilumab (anti-IL-4/IL-13) improved exacerbations and lung function in COPD with blood eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/μL. Mechanisms are currently being investigated. Smoking cessation remains pivotal. Nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) can guide pharmacotherapy. Cytisine and varenicline are effective; e-cigarettes pose safety concerns. Mood disorders and dysfunctional breathing are common in COPD. Addressing these can reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life. Comorbidity management, particularly of cardiovascular risk, obesity, and sleep-disordered breathing, is integral to holistic COPD care.",2025,respiratory
35410227,"Distributions and trends of the global burden of COPD attributable to risk factors by SDI, age, and sex from 1990 to 2019: a systematic analysis of GBD 2019 data.","Global distributions and trends of the risk-attributable burdens of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have rarely been systematically explored. To guide the formulation of targeted and accurate strategies for the management of COPD, we analyzed COPD burdens attributable to known risk factors. Using detailed COPD data from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019, we analyzed disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and deaths attributable to each risk factor from 1990 to 2019. Additionally, we calculated estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) during the study period. The population attributable fraction (PAF) and summary exposure value (SEV) of each risk factor are also presented. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized DALY and death rates of COPD attributable to smoking and household air pollution, occupational particles, secondhand smoke, and low temperature presented consistently declining trends in almost all socio-demographic index (SDI) regions. However, the decline in YLD was not as dramatic as that of the death rate. In contrast, the COPD burden attributable to ambient particulate matter, ozone, and high temperature exposure showed undesirable increasing trends in the low- and low-middle-SDI regions. In addition, the age-standardized DALY and death rates attributable to each risk factor except household air pollution and low temperature were the highest in the low-middle-SDI region. In 2019, the COPD burden attributable to smoking ambient particulate matter, ozone, occupational particles, low and high temperature was obviously greater in males than in females. Meanwhile, the most important risk factors for female varied across regions (low- and low-middle-SDI regions: household air pollution; middle-SDI region: ambient particles; high-middle- and high-SDI region: smoking). Increasing trends of COPD burden attributable to ambient particulate matter, ozone, and high temperature exposure in the low-middle- and low-SDI regions call for an urgent need to implement specific and effective measures. Moreover, considering the gender differences in COPD burdens attributable to some risk factors such as ambient particulate matter and ozone with similar SEV, further research on biological differences between sexes in COPD and relevant policy-making of disease prevention are required.",2022,respiratory
39261873,Tobacco and COPD: presenting the World Health Organization (WHO) Tobacco Knowledge Summary.,"The WHO recently published a Tobacco Knowledge Summary (TKS) synthesizing current evidence on tobacco and COPD, aiming to raise awareness among a broad audience of health care professionals. Furthermore, it can be used as an advocacy tool in the fight for tobacco control and prevention of tobacco-related disease. This article builds on the evidence presented in the TKS, with a greater level of detail intended for a lung-specialist audience. Pulmonologists have a vital role to play in advocating for the health of their patients and the wider population by sharing five key messages: (1) Smoking is the leading cause of COPD in high-income countries, contributing to approximately 70% of cases. Quitting tobacco is an essential step toward better lung health. (2) People with COPD face a significantly higher risk of developing lung cancer. Smoking cessation is a powerful measure to reduce cancer risk. (3) Cardiovascular disease, lung cancer and type-2 diabetes are common comorbidities in people with COPD. Quitting smoking not only improves COPD management, but also reduces the risk of developing these coexisting conditions. (4) Tobacco smoke also significantly impacts children's lung growth and development, increasing the risk of respiratory infections, asthma and up to ten other conditions, and COPD later in life. Governments should implement effective tobacco control measures to protect vulnerable populations. (5) The tobacco industry's aggressive strategies in the marketing of nicotine delivery systems and all tobacco products specifically target children, adolescents, and young adults. Protecting our youth from these harmful tactics is a top priority.",2024,respiratory
35002516,Regulation of lung epithelial cell senescence in smoking-induced COPD/emphysema by microR-125a-5p via Sp1 mediation of SIRT1/HIF-1a.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects the health of more than 300 million people worldwide; at present, there is no effective drug to treat COPD. Smoking is the most important risk factor, but the molecular mechanism by which smoking causes the disease is unclear. The senescence of lung epithelial cells is related to development of COPD. Regulation of miRNAs is the main epigenetic mechanism related to aging. β-Galactose staining showed that the lung tissues of smokers have a higher degree of cellular senescence, and the expression of miR-125a-5p is high. This effect is obvious for smokers with COPD/emphysema, and there is a negative correlation between miR-125a-5p levels and values for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC). After Balb/c mice were chronically exposed to various concentrations of cigarette smoke (CS), plethysmography showed that lung function was impaired, lung tissue senescence was increased, and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was increased. For mouse lung epithelial (MLE)-12 cells treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE), Sp1 and SIRT1 levels were low, HIF-1α acetylation levels were high, and cell senescence and secretion of SASP factors were elevated. Down-regulation of miR-125a-5p or up-regulation of Sp1 reversed these effects. In addition, compared with mice exposed to CS, knockdown of miR-125a-5p reduced lung epithelial cell senescence and COPD/emphysema. Therefore, in smoking-induced COPD, elevated miR-125a-5p participates in the senescence of lung epithelial cells through Sp1/SIRT1/HIF-1α. These findings provide evidence related to the pathogenesis of COPD/emphysema caused by chronic smoking.",2022,respiratory

36539833,Single-cell transcriptomics highlights immunological dysregulations of monocytes in the pathobiology of COPD.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease, whose pathogenetic complexity was strongly associated with aging/smoking and poorly understood. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of 66,610 cells from COPD and age-stratified control lung tissues of donors with different smoking histories to prioritize cell types most perturbed in COPD lungs in aging/smoking dependent or independent manner. By performing an array of advanced bioinformatic analyses, such as gene set enrichment analysis, trajectory analysis, cell-cell interactions analysis, regulatory potential analysis, weighted correlation network analysis, functional interaction analysis, and gene set variation analysis, we integrated cell-type-level alterations into a system-level malfunction and provided a more clarified COPD pathological model containing specific mechanisms by which aging and smoking facilitate COPD development. Finally, we integrated the publicly available scRNA-seq data of 9 individuals, resulting in a total of 110,931 cells, and replicated the analyses to enhance the credibility of our findings. Our study pointed to enrichment of COPD molecular alteration in monocytes, which further induced a previously unrecognized pro-inflammatory effect on alveolar epithelial cells. In addition, aged monocytes and club cells facilitated COPD development via maintaining an autoimmune airway niche. Unexpectedly, macrophages, whose defect to resolve inflammation was long-recognized in COPD pathogenesis, primarily induced an imbalance of sphingolipids rheostat in a smoking-dependent way. These findings were validated in a meta-analysis including other public single-cell transcriptomic data. In sum, our study provided a clarified view of COPD pathogenesis and demonstrated the potential of targeting monocytes in COPD diagnosis and treatment.",2022,respiratory
37708400,IL-33 Expression Is Lower in Current Smokers at both Transcriptomic and Protein Levels.,"<b>Rationale:</b> IL-33 is a proinflammatory cytokine thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent clinical trial using an anti-IL-33 antibody showed a reduction in exacerbation and improved lung function in ex-smokers but not current smokers with COPD. <b>Objectives:</b> This study aimed to understand the effects of smoking status on IL-33. <b>Methods:</b> We investigated the association of smoking status with the level of gene expression of <i>IL-33</i> in the airways in eight independent transcriptomic studies of lung airways. Additionally, we performed Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry for IL-33 in lung tissue to assess protein levels. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Across the bulk RNA-sequencing datasets, <i>IL-33</i> gene expression and its signaling pathway were significantly lower in current versus former or never-smokers and increased upon smoking cessation (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Single-cell sequencing showed that <i>IL-33</i> is predominantly expressed in resting basal epithelial cells and decreases during the differentiation process triggered by smoke exposure. We also found a higher transitioning of this cellular subpopulation into a more differentiated cell type during chronic smoking, potentially driving the reduction of <i>IL-33</i>. Protein analysis demonstrated lower IL-33 levels in lung tissue from current versus former smokers with COPD and a lower proportion of IL-33-positive basal cells in current versus ex-smoking controls. <b>Conclusions:</b> We provide strong evidence that cigarette smoke leads to an overall reduction in IL-33 expression in transcriptomic and protein level, and this may be due to the decrease in resting basal cells. Together, these findings may explain the clinical observation that a recent antibody-based anti-IL-33 treatment is more effective in former than current smokers with COPD.",2023,respiratory
33325455,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - diagnosis and management of stable disease; a personalized approach to care, using the treatable traits concept based on clinical phenotypes. Position paper of the Czech Pneumological and Phthisiological Society.","This position paper has been drafted by experts from the Czech national board of diseases with bronchial obstruction, of the Czech Pneumological and Phthisiological Society. The statements and recommendations are based on both the results of randomized controlled trials and data from cross-sectional and prospective real-life studies to ensure they are as close as possible to the context of daily clinical practice and the current health care system of the Czech Republic. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable heterogeneous syndrome with a number of pulmonary and extrapulmonary clinical features and concomitant chronic diseases. The disease is associated with significant mortality, morbidity and reduced quality of life. The main characteristics include persistent respiratory symptoms and only partially reversible airflow obstruction developing due to an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles and gases. Oxidative stress, protease-antiprotease imbalance and increased numbers of pro-inflammatory cells (mainly neutrophils) are the main drivers of primarily non-infectious inflammation in COPD. Besides smoking, household air pollution, occupational exposure, low birth weight, frequent respiratory infections during childhood and also genetic factors are important risk factors of COPD development. Progressive airflow limitation and airway remodelling leads to air trapping, static and dynamic hyperinflation, gas exchange abnormalities and decreased exercise capacity. Various features of the disease are expressed unequally in individual patients, resulting in various types of disease presentation, emerging as the ""clinical phenotypes"" (for specific clinical characteristics) and ""treatable traits"" (for treatable characteristics) concept. The estimated prevalence of COPD in Czechia is around 6.7% with 3,200-3,500 deaths reported annually. The elementary requirements for diagnosis of COPD are spirometric confirmation of post-bronchodilator airflow obstruction (post-BD FEV<sub>1</sub>/VCmax <70%) and respiratory symptoms assessement (dyspnoea, exercise limitation, cough and/or sputum production. In order to establish definite COPD diagnosis, a five-step evaluation should be performed, including: 1/ inhalation risk assessment, 2/ symptoms evaluation, 3/ lung function tests, 4/ laboratory tests and 5/ imaging. At the same time, all alternative diagnoses should be excluded. For disease classification, this position paper uses both GOLD stages (1 to 4), GOLD groups (A to D) and evaluation of clinical phenotype(s). Prognosis assessment should be done in each patient. For this purpose, we recommend the use of the BODE or the CADOT index. Six elementary clinical phenotypes are recognized, including chronic bronchitis, frequent exacerbator, emphysematous, asthma/COPD overlap (ACO), bronchiectases with COPD overlap (BCO) and pulmonary cachexia. In our concept, all of these clinical phenotypes are also considered independent treatable traits. For each treatable trait, specific pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies are defined in this document. The coincidence of two or more clinical phenotypes (i.e., treatable traits) may occur in a single individual, giving the opportunity of fully individualized, phenotype-specific treatment. Treatment of COPD should reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease and be tailored to individual patients. Major goals of COPD treatment are symptom reduction and decreased exacerbation risk. Treatment strategy is divided into five strata: risk elimination, basic treatment, phenotype-specific treatment, treatment of respiratory failure and palliative care, and treatment of comorbidities. Risk elimination includes interventions against tobacco smoking and environmental/occupational exposures. Basic treatment is based on bronchodilator therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, vaccination, care for appropriate nutrition, inhalation training, education and psychosocial support. Adequate phenotype-specific treatment varies phenotype by phenotype, including more than ten different pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies. If more than one clinical phenotype is present, treatment strategy should follow the expression of each phenotypic label separately. In such patients, multicomponental therapeutic regimens are needed, resulting in fully individualized care. In the future, stronger measures against smoking, improvements in occupational and environmental health, early diagnosis strategies, as well as biomarker identification for patients responsive to specific treatments are warranted. New classes of treatment (inhaled PDE3/4 inhibitors, single molecule dual bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory drugs, gene editing molecules or new bronchoscopic procedures) are expected to enter the clinical practice in a very few years.",2020,respiratory

Current available evidence, however, indicates that the pathogenesis of COPD needs to consider the dynamic and cumulative nature of a series of environment (including smoking plus other exposures)-host interactions that eventually determine lung development, maintenance, repair, and aging. By doing so, these factors modulate the trajectory of lung function of the individual through life and the odds of developing COPD through different routes, which likely represent different forms of the disease that require different preventive and therapeutic strategies.",2020,respiratory
39542274,A comprehensive review of ferroptosis in environmental pollutants-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common chronic lung disease that impacts hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide.

Despite the availability of treatments to alleviate symptoms of COPD, it continues to exert a serious health and socioeconomic burden. Ferroptosis, a unique form of iron-dependent cell death distinguished by lipid peroxidation, is implicated in various diseases. Recent studies, utilizing COPD patients samples, animal models, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, have revealed that ferroptosis is involved in pathogenesis of COPD.

29628376,Childhood predictors of lung function trajectories and future COPD risk: a prospective cohort study from the first to the sixth decade of life.,"Lifetime lung function is related to quality of life and longevity. Over the lifespan, individuals follow different lung function trajectories. Identification of these trajectories, their determinants, and outcomes is important, but no study has done this beyond the fourth decade. We used six waves of the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS) to model lung function trajectories measured at 7, 13, 18, 45, 50, and 53 years. We analysed pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> z-scores at the six timepoints using group-based trajectory modelling to identify distinct subgroups of individuals whose measurements followed a similar pattern over time. We related the trajectories identified to childhood factors and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using logistic regression, and estimated population-attributable fractions of COPD. Of the 8583 participants in the original cohort, 2438 had at least two waves of lung function data at age 7 years and 53 years and comprised the study population. We identified six trajectories: early below average, accelerated decline (97 [4%] participants); persistently low (136 [6%] participants); early low, accelerated growth, normal decline (196 [8%] participants); persistently high (293 [12%] participants); below average (772 [32%] participants); and average (944 [39%] participants). The three trajectories early below average, accelerated decline; persistently low; and below average had increased risk of COPD at age 53 years compared with the average group (early below average, accelerated decline: odds ratio 35·0, 95% CI 19·5-64·0; persistently low: 9·5, 4·5-20·6; and below average: 3·7, 1·9-6·9). Early-life predictors of the three trajectories included childhood asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, allergic rhinitis, eczema, parental asthma, and maternal smoking. Personal smoking and active adult asthma increased the impact of maternal smoking and childhood asthma, respectively, on the early below average, accelerated decline trajectory. We identified six potential FEV<sub>1</sub> trajectories, two of which were novel. Three trajectories contributed 75% of COPD burden and were associated with modifiable early-life exposures whose impact was aggravated by adult factors. We postulate that reducing maternal smoking, encouraging immunisation, and avoiding personal smoking, especially in those with smoking parents or low childhood lung function, might minimise COPD risk. Clinicians and patients with asthma should be made aware of the potential long-term implications of non-optimal asthma control for lung function trajectory throughout life, and the role and benefit of optimal asthma control on improving lung function should be investigated in future intervention trials.

It's important to assess the current burden of COPD and its risk factors on a geographical basis to guide health policy. Data on the prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) related to COPD, and risk-attributable burden were obtained from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 database. The relationship between COPD DALYs and the sociodemographic index (SDI) was estimated using Smoothing Splines models. Between 1990 and 2021, the changes were -1.46% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] -3.36% to 0.39%) in age-standardized prevalence, -37.12% (-43.37% to -27.68%) in mortality, and -36.98% (-42.37% to -28.54%) in DALYs rate. In 2021, a total of 213.39 million prevalent cases of COPD were estimated. The age-standardized prevalence of COPD increased with age and was more common in males. The age-standardized COPD DALYs had a reversed U-shaped relationship with SDI at the regional level, with the highest burden at an SDI of about 0.45. At the global level, smoking had the highest influence on COPD DALYs, accounting for 34.8%, followed by ambient particulate matter pollution (22.2%), household air pollution from solid fuels (19.5%), and occupational particulate matter, gases, and fumes (15.8%). The overall burden of COPD has been increasing despite improvements in some rates since 1990.

The comorbidities include: cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, denutrition, obesity, ageing, anemia, sleeping disorders, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, anxiety-depression and lung cancer. The prognosis worsens with one or more comorbidities. Clinicians are faced with the challenge of finding practical and appropriate ways of treating these comorbidities, and there is increasing interest in developing a global, multidisciplinary approach to management.

An increased prevalence of COPD was associated with increasing age, smoking and biomass smoke exposure. The pooled odds ratio for the effect of current smoking (vs. never smoked) on COPD was 2.20 (95% CI 1.62-2.99).<b>CONCLUSION:</b> COPD causes morbidity and mortality in adults in SSA. Smoking is an important risk factor for COPD in SSA, and this exposure needs to be reduced through the combined efforts of clinicians, researchers and policymakers to address this debilitating and preventable lung disease.",2022,respiratory
40197280,"Mapping the Global distribution, risk factors, and temporal trends of COPD incidence and mortality (1990-2021): ecological analysis.","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) remains a significant global public health challenge, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study aims to analyze global trends in COPD from 1990 to 2021, with a focus on age, sex, and regional variations. By assessing the global burden of COPD and its association with key risk factors, this research provides critical insights into progress toward health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and underscores the urgent need to prioritize COPD in public health agendas. Utilizing data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, this research conducted a comprehensive ecological analysis of COPD epidemiology from 1990 to 2021. Key measures included incidence, mortality, and age-standardized rates, alongside an examination of risk factors such as smoking and ambient particulate matter pollution, quantified using country-level summary exposure values (SEV). Statistical analyses, including descriptive analysis, annual rate of change (ARC), and correlation analysis, were applied to assess the burden of COPD and investigate its ecological associations with major risk factors. In 2021, COPD accounted for 16.90 million new cases and 3.70 million deaths globally. The age-standardized incidence rate was 197.37 (95% UI: 181.6-213.42) per 100,000 person-years, while the age-standardized mortality rate was 45.22 (95% UI: 40.61-49.70) per 100,000 person-years. Although global COPD incidence rates declined by 2% from 1990 to 2021, the pace and extent of this decline varied, with some age groups, sexes, and regions experiencing slower reductions or even increases. Higher COPD burden was observed in areas with elevated smoking prevalence, air pollution and greater socioeconomic development. This study highlights the ongoing global burden of COPD and its varying trends from 1990 to 2021 across age groups, sexes, and regions. While incidence and mortality rates have slightly declined, disparities persist, particularly among older adults, men, and regions with higher smoking prevalence and air pollution. These findings emphasize the urgent need to integrate COPD into public health priorities, focusing on targeted interventions to reduce key risk factors. Sustained efforts are essential to achieving health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and improving global COPD outcomes.",2025,respiratory
39601881,Estimating the Impact of Asthma and COPD on Lung Cancer Screening in the USA.,"Examine the association of asthma, COPD, and Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) on rates of lung cancer screening. 2022 Behavior and Risk Factors Surveillance Survey was used for cross-sectional analysis of self-reported lung cancer screening prevalence in those with COPD, asthma, and ACO, with stratification by smoking status. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the relationship between asthma, COPD, ACO and lung cancer screening status. 17.9% of eligible adults were up-to-date on lung cancer screening. Those with COPD and ACO had higher rates of ever undergoing lung cancer screening (50.8% and 47.5%) than those with asthma (26.4%) or neither condition (23%). Adults with COPD (adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.86, 95% CI 2.49-3.28) and ACO (aOR: 2.85, 95% CI 2.49-3.28) had increased odds of ever having lung cancer screening compared with those without either condition. Stratification by smoking status shows that individuals who formerly smoked had slightly higher odds of ever undergoing screening than individuals currently smoking. Lung cancer screening rates have increased; however, it remains low. Adults with COPD and ACO are more likely to undergo lung cancer screening.",2024,respiratory
39694677,What is the true target population for biologics in real-life COPD or asthma-COPD overlap patients?,"Biologics provide significant benefits in asthma, reducing exacerbations and symptoms. Some biologics have shown promising results in small subgroups of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and frequent exacerbations. Nevertheless, real-life data on the size of the COPD target population remain scarce. We analysed the characteristics of COPD and coexisting asthma and COPD patients included in the prospective multicentre, French COhort of BRonchial obstruction and Asthma, between 2008 and 2023 and evaluated the number of patients who could correspond to the inclusion criteria of randomised controlled trials evaluating various biologics targeting interleukin 33 (IL-33) (-receptor), IL-5 (-receptor), IL-4Rα or TSLP, in routine clinical practice. Among 434 COPD patients, only 21.7% met inclusion criteria for at least one biologic. Among patients with asthma, 54 (3.5%) had coexisting features of COPD in terms of age, smoking status and airflow obstruction and met inclusion criteria for at least one biologic. Notably, these patients were predominantly female, with worse lung function. Globally, the target chronic airway diseases population of the eagerly awaited biologics remains limited to a small part (ie, 1.3%-8%, depending on the biologic). In a real-life COPD and asthma population (including asthmatic patients with features of COPD), the proportion of patients satisfying selection criteria applied in randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy of biologics remains limited to less than 10% of the whole population.",2024,respiratory

Current epidemiological studies focus on local geography, and there is a lack of global-level analysis. This study provides in-depth analyses of the disease burden of young COPD at global, regional, and national levels. This study used the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD). The age-standardised prevalence rate (ASPR), age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardised death rate (ASDR), and age-standardised disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate were used to describe the disease burden. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) during the study period was calculated. Joinpoint regression analysis examined the time trend from 1990 to 2021. Annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) were calculated. Risk factors were reported by region and sex. In 2021, the global number of young COPD cases was 30,384,539, and the ASPR, ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardised DALYs rates fell slightly. Oceania reported the highest ASPR, ASDR, and age-standardised DALYs rate. High-income North America has the highest ASIR. In 2021, the prevalence, incidence, death, and DALYs rates exhibited similar trends, increasing with age. From 1990 to 2021, both the prevalence and death rates showed a consistent downward trend across all age groups. Joinpoint regression analysis indicated a slight increase in both the ASPR (APC: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.19) and the ASIR (APC: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.24) during the period from 1990 to 1994. The leading DALYs attributable to risk factors for young COPD are household air pollution from solid fuels (20.4%), ambient particulate matter pollution (17.9%), and smoking (13.5%). The global burden of ASPR, ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardised DALYs rates in young COPD has decreased, however, the absolute number of patients has increased. The global burden shows noticeable regional differences, with particularly high burdens observed in Oceania. Improving air quality, promoting smoking cessation, and increasing access to lung function tests, raising awareness of young COPD are key strategies for alleviating the burden of young COPD.",2025,respiratory

Preliminary evidence suggested the associations could be modified by air pollution. This study aims to examine whether air pollution levels modify the associations of PA with all-cause mortality and incident cancer, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), type 2 diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A total of 414,644 UK Biobank participants were included in the analyses. PA was self-reported and objectively measured using accelerometers. PA was self-reported with IPAQ and objectively measured using accelerometers. Annual PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO air pollutant concentrations in 2010 were measured using a European land use regression model. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the associations of PA and air pollution with health outcomes. Multiplicative and additive interactions were estimated. During the study period from 2006 to 2022, 31,765 (7.7%) died, 70,299 (17.0%) had incident cancer, 25,130 (8.5%) had type 2 diabetes, 33,284 (8.0%) had MACE, and 18,844 (4.5%) had COPD. Lower PA was associated with higher risk of all health outcomes. Higher concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with all outcomes except for cancer.

Worldwide, COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality; smoking tobacco is the most important risk factor. This translational review of recent updates in COPD care for the primary care audience, includes recommendations from the 2015 Global Initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) report on diagnosis, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment, prevalence of comorbidities, management of exacerbations and the asthma and COPD overlap syndrome, with a focus on the importance and benefit of physical activity and exercise in COPD patients. Exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to the overall severity of COPD in individual patients. Management of exacerbations includes reducing the impact of the current exacerbation and preventing development of subsequent episodes. Healthcare professionals need to be alert to comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, anxiety/depression, lung cancer, infections and diabetes, which are common in COPD patients and can have a significant impact on HRQoL and prognosis. Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended by a number of guidelines for all symptomatic COPD patients, regardless of severity, and involves exercise training, patient education, nutritional advice and psychosocial support. At all stages of COPD, regular physical activity and exercise can aid symptom control, improve HRQoL, reduce rates of hospitalization, and improve morbidity and respiratory mortality. Healthcare professionals play a pivotal role in improving HRQoL and health-related outcomes in COPD patients to meet their specific needs and in providing appropriate diagnosis, management and advice on smoking cessation.",2016,respiratory
26024348,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease secondary to household air pollution.,"Approximately 3 billion people around the world cook and heat their homes using solid fuels in open fires and rudimentary stoves, resulting in household air pollution. Household air pollution secondary to indoor combustion of solid fuel is associated with multiple chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes. The exposure is associated with both chronic bronchitis and emphysema phenotypes of COPD as well as a distinct form of obstructive airway disease called bronchial anthracofibrosis. COPD from household air pollution differs from COPD from tobacco smoke with respect to its disproportionately greater bronchial involvement, lesser emphysematous change, greater impact on quality of life, and possibly greater oxygen desaturation and pulmonary hypertensive changes. Interventions that decrease exposure to biomass smoke may decrease the risk for incident COPD and attenuate the longitudinal decline in lung function, but more data on exposure-response relationships from well-designed longitudinal studies are needed.",2015,respiratory
28671769,Chronic coffee consumption and respiratory disease: A systematic review.,"The widespread consumption of coffee means that any biological effects from its use can lead to significant public health consequences. Chronic pulmonary diseases are extremely prevalent and responsible for one of every six deaths on a global level. Major medical databases for studies reporting on the effects of coffee or caffeine consumption on a wide range of non-malignant respiratory outcomes, including incidence, prevalence, evolution or severity of respiratory disease in adults were searched. Studies on lung function and respiratory mortality were also considered. Fifteen studies, including seven cohort, six cross-sectional, one case control and one randomized control trial were found. Coffee consumption was generally associated with a reduction in prevalence of asthma. The association of coffee with natural honey was an effective treatment for persistent post-infectious cough. One case-control study found higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with coffee consumption. No association was found with the evolution of COPD or sarcoidosis. Coffee was associated with a reduction in respiratory mortality, and one study found improved lung function in coffee consumers. Smoking was a significant confounder in most studies. Coffee consumption was associated with some positive effects on the respiratory system. There was however limited available evidence, mostly from cross sectional and retrospective studies. The only prospective cohort studies were those reporting on respiratory mortality. These results suggest that coffee consumption may be a part of a healthy lifestyle leading to reduced respiratory morbidity.",2018,respiratory
26636168,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease--diagnosis and classification of severity.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, progressive and preventable non-communicable respiratory disorder. It is often confused with asthma and poorly understood by many lay people. The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoking, but in the South African (SA) context, biomass fuel exposure/household pollution, tuberculosis, HIV and mining exposure are additional important causes.There is a very high prevalence of COPD in SA and it is the third leading cause of mortality globally.The diagnosis of COPD is based predominantly on symptoms, i.e. progressive shortness of breath and cough in a patient with risk factors–usually smoking. Lung function testing is required to formally make the diagnosis, which places a significant hurdle in correctly identifying COPD in SA, given the limited access to spirometry in many areas. Spirometry is also required to grade the severity of lung function obstruction.Severity assessment, which is used to plan a management strategy (predominantly bronchodilators with inhaled steroids in severe cases), combines symptoms, lung function and exacerbations. Based on these 3 factors, a patient can be categorised into 1 of 4 groups and appropriate management instituted. Additional comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular and mental illness, should also be evaluated.Early identification of COPD, with further avoidance of an aetiological cause such as smoking, is key in preventing disease progression.Appropriate therapy, comprising non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions and based on a comprehensive severity assessment, should result in symptom improvement and reduced risk for exacerbations.",2015,respiratory
38364200,Susceptible Young Adults and Development of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Later in Life.,"<b>Rationale:</b> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has its origin in early life, and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) proposes a predisease state termed ""pre-COPD."" <b>Objectives:</b> We tested the hypothesis that susceptible young adults identified with chronic bronchitis and subtle lung function impairment will develop COPD later in life. <b>Methods:</b> We followed random individuals without COPD ages 20-50 years from two population-based cohorts from different smoking eras-the Copenhagen General Population Study from 2003 (<i>N</i> = 5,497) and the Copenhagen City Heart Study from 1976-1978 (<i>N</i> = 2,609)-for 10 and 25 years, for the development of COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC <0.70) and COPD GOLD Stages 2-4 (additionally, FEV<sub>1</sub> <80% predicted). <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> After 10 years, 28% developed COPD and 13% developed COPD GOLD Stages 2-4 in individuals susceptible to COPD, compared with 8% and 1% in those without any susceptibility to COPD. Correspondingly, after 25 years, 22% versus 13% developed COPD and 20% versus 8% developed COPD GOLD Stages 2-4. More than half of incident COPD cases developed from a susceptible state. Compared with those without susceptibility to COPD, multivariable-adjusted odds ratios in those susceptible to COPD were 3.42 (95% confidence interval: 2.78-4.21) for COPD and 10.1 (6.77-15.2) for COPD GOLD Stages 2-4 after 10 years and were 1.54 (1.23-1.93) and 2.12 (1.64-2.73) after 25 years. The ability of a COPD risk score-consisting of the state of susceptibility to COPD with smoking and asthma as risk factors-to predict COPD later in life was high. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study suggests the existence of a predisease state of COPD, which can be used for early identification of susceptible individuals at risk for COPD later in life.",2024,respiratory

Meanwhile, rapidly increasing use of heated tobacco products (HTPs) is observed in Japan; however, the status of HTPs use has not been fully understood in adults with COPD, asthma, and ACO. This study aimed to reveal the association between COPD, asthma, and ACO and HTPs use in adults. Data on Japanese individuals ≥ 40 years old obtained from the Japan Society and New Tobacco Internet Survey were analyzed. The prevalence of HTPs use in adults with COPD, asthma, and ACO, among individuals categorized into three groups according to cigarette smoking (never, former, and current), was calculated and the relationship between each disease and HTPs use were evaluated. The clinical diagnosis of these diseases was based on the self-reported diagnosis, as obtained from questionnaires. A total of 19,308 individuals were included. The proportions of never, past, and current cigarettes smokers were 10,900 (56.5%), 4,903 (25.4%), and 3,505 (18.2%), respectively, and that of HTPs use was 1,813 (9.4%). In current cigarettes smokers, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of HTPs use was 2.88 (95% CI [confidence interval], 1.86-4.47), 1.23 (95% CI, 0.99-1.52), and 5.81 (95% CI, 3.12-10.82) in adults with COPD, asthma, and ACO compared to those without these respiratory diseases, respectively.

This study aims to document the demographic, symptomatic, and therapeutic characteristics of COPD patients receiving outpatient pulmonary care in Hungary, focusing on smoking history, and evaluate their distribution according to the GOLD A/B/E classification. The study recorded demographic data, symptom severity, occurrence of severe and moderate exacerbations, treatment, comorbidities, quality of life, and COVID-19 vaccination status among COPD patients from November 2021 to January 2023. A total of 6974 patients were categorized into current smokers, former smokers, and never smokers. Patients had an average age of 67.2±8.9 years, with 48.2% male and 51.8% female. Of participants, 86.1% had a smoking history, while 13.9% had never smoked. COPD patients who had never smoked showed significantly better quality of life (CAT: 15.2±7.6 vs 15.8±6.9; p=0.006), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>%: 96.7±2.3 vs 95.8±2.4; p<0.001), higher body mass index (BMI: 29.4±5.9 vs 27.1±6.3; p<0.001), and better lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>ref%: 67.9±20.7 vs 58.9±18.1; p<0.001) compared to smokers. However, non-smoking COPD patients had a higher frequency of comorbidities (3.5±2.2 vs 2.9±2.1; p<0.05). These differences may arise from complex genetic and environmental interactions.

Exposure and outcome data from the largest available genome-wide association studies were extracted for Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. Univariate MR analysis was performed using IVW as the primary analysis method, and multiple sensitivity analyses were used to enhance the robustness of the results. Furthermore, this was followed by mediation MR analysis of positive results after excluding confounding factors with multivariable MR analysis. The MR estimation based on IVW method indicated a strong association between genetically determined COPD and heart failure (HF) (OR = 1.117, 95% CI: 1.066-1.170, p <0.001), coronary heart disease (CHD) (OR = 1.004, 95% CI: 1.002-1.006, p <0.001), essential hypertension (EH) (OR = 1.009, 95% CI: 1.005-1.013, p <0.001) as well as Stroke (OR = 1.003, 95% CI: 1.001-1.004, p <0.001). The results of multivariable MR analysis revealed that COPD is not significantly associated with CHD after adjusting for IL-6, LDL, or total cholesterol (p>0.05). Our findings indicated that BMI, smoking initiation, smoking status, obesity, and FEV1 played a role in the causal effect of COPD on HF, EH, and Stroke. We found positive causal relationships between COPD and HF, EH, and Stroke essentially unaffected by other confounding factors. The causal relationship exhibited between COPD and CHD was influenced by confounding factors. BMI, obesity, initiation of smoking, smoking status, and FEV1 were the mediators between COPD and CVDs.",2024,respiratory

38403592,Unraveling the causality between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and its common comorbidities using bidirectional Mendelian randomization.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently coexists with various diseases, yet the causal relationship between COPD and these comorbidities remains ambiguous. As a result, the aim of our study is to elucidate the potential causality between COPD and its common comorbidities. We employed the Mendelian randomization (MR) method to analyze single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of common comorbidities with COPD from FinnGen and Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) databases. Causality was primarily assessed using the inverse variance weighting (IVW) method. Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analysis was also conducted to eliminate the interference of smoking-related phenotypes. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure the reliability of our findings. Preliminary univariable MR revealed an increased risk of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (IVW: OR = 1.757, 95% CI = 1.162-2.657, P = 0.008), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (IVW: OR = 1.193, 95% CI = 1.072-1.326, P < 0.001), chronic periodontitis (IVW: OR = 1.213, 95% CI = 1.038-1.417, P = 0.012), and heart failure (HF) (IVW: OR = 1.127, 95% CI = 1.043-1.218, P = 0.002). Additionally, the reverse MR analysis indicated that genetic susceptibility to HF (IVW: OR = 1.272, 95% CI = 1.084-1.493, P = 0.003), obesity (IVW: OR = 1.128, 95% CI = 1.056-1.205, P < 0.001), depression (IVW: OR = 1.491, 95% CI = 1.257-1.770, P < 0.001), and sleep apnea syndrome (IVW: OR = 1.209, 95% CI = 1.087-1.345, P < 0.001) could raise the risk of COPD. The MVMR analysis showed no causal effect of COPD on susceptibility to chronic periodontitis after adjusting for smoking. Our study identified that COPD may elevate the risk of LUSC, HF, and CKD. Additionally, our analysis revealed that HF, sleep apnea symptoms, depression, and obesity might also increase the susceptibility to COPD. These findings revealed a potential causal relationship between COPD and several prevalent comorbidities, which may provide new insights for disease early prediction and prevention.",2024,respiratory

However, in comparison to subject with only COPD, ACOS subjects were significantly younger, had higher BMI, healthcare utilization, and lower HRQoL. ACOS is a common condition that exists in a substantial proportion of subjects with COPD. ACOS represents a distinct clinical phenotype with more frequent exacerbations, hospitalization, worse health-related quality of life, and higher healthcare costs than either disease alone. There is a critical need to better define the management and treatment of this syndrome.",2015,respiratory
39668106,Association between birth weight and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the UK Biobank: a prospective cohort study.,"Birth weight has been reported to be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adulthood, but the results have not yet been determined. This study aims to analyse the potential association of birth weight with COPD risk in UK Biobank. We conducted a prospective analysis for participants without baseline COPD in UK Biobank. The HRs and 95% CIs were calculated by multivariable Cox regression models, and dose-response relationship was evaluated by restricted cubic splines. Besides, we also calculated the interactions for covariates and further analysed the joint effects. A total of 251 172 participants with birth weight data were included in this study, and 5602 COPD cases were found during follow-up. According to Cox regression models, participants with the lowest quintile of birth weight (< 2.86 kg) had higher risk for COPD (HR=1.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.32). In addition, the dose‒response analysis showed a non-linear relationship between birth weight and COPD risk, which first decreased and then increased, and the interactions for age, passive smoking and maternal smoking were also found by stratified analysis. Furthermore, we also found the joint effects between COPD risk and maternal smoking in the lowest quintile group. This study indicated that lower birth weight may increase the risk of COPD. The non-linear associations between birth weight and COPD risk for prospective cohort; as birth weight increased, the risk showed a trend of decreasing first and then increasing. Moreover, maternal smoking had a joint effect with low birth weight for COPD risk.",2024,respiratory
39392247,"Risk Factors for Adults with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in the United States, Utilizing State-Based Surveillance.","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a complex and heterogeneous condition. Exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollutants are key risk factors for COPD development; however, other risk factors include race/ethnicity, sex of adults, a history of asthma, occupational exposures, and chronic respiratory infections. Data for the current study were from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. Chi-squares and multinomial logistic regression analyses, adjusted with the survey's sampling weight, were used to examine how critical health indicators impacted a COPD diagnosis. Participants (<i>N</i> = 311,175) were adults aged 45 years and older. Adjusted multinomial regression analyses showed adults who reported asthma, current and former smoking, poor physical health, depression, less physical activity, and fatigue were more likely to report COPD. Those with COPD were more likely to be male than female. Moreover, those with COPD reported higher rates of health insurance coverage, and yet had lower income and more financial difficulty affording a doctor for health services. In a follow up regression analysis, examining racial differences in COPD for participants, American Indian adults had a higher odds of reporting COPD than the ""other"" race groups. Because COPD remains a leading cause of death and disability in the U.S., and racial disparities persist in respiratory outcomes, continuing to identify risk factors for vulnerable groups could assist health program planners with development of successful health messaging.",2024,respiratory
30674376,Elucidating the risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an umbrella review of meta-analyses.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is commonly attributed to smoking, and other potential risk factors are ignored. We aimed to critically appraise the epidemiological credibility of the risk factors for COPD that have been examined in published meta-analyses. We performed a systematic search to capture systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies on environmental factors and biomarkers for risk of COPD. We applied a set of standardised methodological criteria based on the level of statistical significance, sample size, between-study heterogeneity and statistical biases. Our search yielded 11 eligible papers, including 18 meta-analyses on environmental factors or biomarkers for COPD risk, and eight eligible papers with systematic reviews only. Eleven associations achieved statistical significance at <i>P</i> < 0.001 and six associations at <i>P</i> < 1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>. Thirteen associations presented an <i>I</i>²  50%, while six associations had evidence of small-study effects and/or excess significance bias. History of tuberculosis or rheumatoid arthritis, exposure to biomass fuels, tobacco smoking and second hand smoking were supported by high epidemiological credibility for an increased risk of COPD. Furthermore, highly suggestive evidence was found for increased levels of serum C-reactive protein, and serum fibrinogen in COPD patients compared with healthy controls. To summarise, our approach suggests that, while a proportion of COPD patients are non-smokers, only a narrow range of risk factors not related to smoking have been studied for an association with COPD. There is also a need to decipher possible protective factors in COPD pathogenesis given that more than a half of ever-smokers do not develop COPD.",2019,respiratory
40125072,"COPD Exacerbations, Air Pollutant Fluctuations, and Individual-Level Factors in the Pandemic Era.","Pandemic-era associations between air pollutant exposures and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are under-explored. Given the considerable observed pandemic-era pollutant fluctuations, these associations were investigated along with possible individual-level risk factors. Participants with spirometry-confirmed COPD from Canadian Cohort Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) were included, with data collected before (""pre-pandemic"") and during (""pandemic"") the COVID-19 pandemic. Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), total oxidant (O<sub>x</sub>) and weather data were obtained from national databases. Associations between each air pollutant and ""symptom-based"" exacerbations (increased dyspnea or sputum volume/purulence ≥48hrs) and ""event-based"" exacerbations (""symptom-based"" plus requiring antibiotics, corticosteroids, or unscheduled healthcare use) were estimated in separate models. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were reported as rate ratios (RRs) per interquartile range (IQR) increment in pollutant concentration with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and O<sub>x</sub> (NO<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations (but not O<sub>3</sub>) fell significantly during the pandemic. In the 673 participants with COPD included, both symptom-based and event-based exacerbation rates were likewise significantly higher during the pre-pandemic period. During the pre-pandemic period, O<sub>x</sub> was positively associated with symptom-based exacerbations (RR: 1.21 [1.08,1.36]). During the pandemic period, O<sub>x</sub> was positively associated with symptom-based (1.46 [1.13,1.89]) and event-based (1.43 [1.00,2.05]) exacerbations. Fewer self-reported pandemic protective behaviors, and higher viral infectious symptoms, were also associated with exacerbations. In stepwise multivariable risk-factor analyses, female gender (1.23 [1.04,1.45] and 1.41 [1.13,1.76]) and co-morbid asthma (1.65 [1.34,2.03] and 1.54 [1.19,2.00]) were associated with symptom-based and event-based exacerbations, respectively, blood eosinophils (1.42 [1.10,1.84]) were associated with event-based exacerbations, and each IQR increment in O<sub>x</sub> was associated with symptom-based exacerbations (1.31 [1.06,1.61]).

34172472,Associations of genetic risk and smoking with incident COPD.,"Genetic factors and smoking contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but whether a combined polygenic risk score (PRS) is associated with incident COPD and whether it has a synergistic effect on smoking remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association of the PRS with COPD and explore whether smoking behaviours could modify such association. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for the association of the PRS and smoking with COPD. The study included 439 255 participants (mean age 56.5 years; 53.9% female), with a median follow-up of 9.0 years. PRS<sub>lasso</sub> containing 2.5 million variants showed better discrimination and a stronger association for incident COPD than PRS<sub>279</sub> containing 279 genome-wide significance variants. Compared with low genetic risk, the HRs of medium and high genetic risk were 1.39 (95% CI 1.31-1.48) and 2.40 (95% CI 2.24-2.56), respectively. The HR of high genetic risk and current smoking was 11.62 (95% CI 10.31-13.10) times that of low genetic risk and never smoking. There were significant interactions between PRS<sub>lasso</sub> and smoking status for incident COPD (p<sub>interaction</sub><0.001). From low genetic risk to high genetic risk, the HRs of current smoking increased from 4.32 (95% CI 3.69-5.06) to 6.89 (95% CI 6.21-7.64) and the population-attributable risks of smoking increased from 42.7% to 61.1%. The PRS constructed from millions of variants below genome-wide significance showed significant associations with incident COPD. Participants with a high genetic risk may be more susceptible to developing COPD when exposed to smoking.",2022,respiratory
29263658,Smoking history and emphysema in asthma-COPD overlap.,"Emphysema is a distinct feature for classifying COPD, and smoking history (≥10 pack-years) is one of several newly proposed criteria for asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). We studied whether or not a smoking history (≥10 pack-years) and emphysema are useful markers for classifying ACO and differentiating it from asthma with chronic airflow obstruction (CAO). We retrospectively studied the mortalities and frequencies of exacerbation in 256 consecutive patients with ACO (161 with emphysema and 95 without emphysema) who had ≥10 pack-years smoking history, 64 asthma patients with CAO but less of a smoking history (<10 pack-years) and 537 consecutive patients with COPD (452 with emphysema and 85 without emphysema) from 2000 to 2016. In the patients with emergent admission, the causes were classified into COPD exacerbation, asthma attack, and others. No asthma patients with CAO had emphysema according to computed tomography findings. The prognoses were significantly better in patients with asthma and CAO than in those with ACO and COPD and better in those with ACO than in those with COPD. In both ACO and COPD patients, the prognoses were better in patients without emphysema than in those with it (<i>P</i>=0.027 and <i>P</i>=0.023, respectively). The frequencies of emergent admission were higher in COPD patients than in ACO patients, and higher in patients with emphysema than in patients without emphysema. ACO/emphysema (+) patients experienced more frequent admission due to COPD exacerbation (<i>P</i><0.001), while ACO/emphysema (-) patients experienced more frequent admission due to asthma attack (<i>P</i>=0.014). A smoking history (≥10 pack-years) was found to be a useful marker for differentiating ACO and asthma with CAO, and emphysema was a useful marker for classifying ACO. These markers are useful for predicting the overall survival and frequency of exacerbation.",2017,respiratory
30578969,The roles of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by a progressive and irreversible airflow obstruction, with an abnormal lung function. The etiology of COPD correlates with complex interactions between environmental and genetic determinants. However, the exact pathogenesis of COPD is obscure although it involves multiple aspects including oxidative stress, imbalance between proteolytic and anti-proteolytic activity, immunity and inflammation, apoptosis, and repair and destruction in both airways and lungs. Many genes have been demonstrated to be involved in those pathogenic processes of this disease in patients exposed to harmful environmental factors. Previous reports have investigated promising microRNAs (miRNAs) to disclose the molecular mechanisms for COPD development induced by different environmental exposure and genetic predisposition encounter, and find some potential miRNA biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment targets of COPD. In this review, we summarized the expression profiles of the reported miRNAs from studies of COPD associated with environmental risk factors including cigarette smoking and air pollution exposures, and provided an overview of roles of those miRNAs in the pathogenesis of the disease. We also highlighted the potential utility and limitations of miRNAs serving as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for COPD.",2019,respiratory

Recent development of the lung organoid culture system has opened new avenues for respiratory disease research as organoids are proving to be a sophisticated ex vivo model that functionally and structurally mimics the human lungs better than other traditionally used models. This review will discuss how recent advances in lung organoid systems may help us better determine the injurious and immunological effect of smoking on human lungs and will provide some suggestions for future research directions.",2022,respiratory
34168440,Update on Asthma-COPD Overlap (ACO): A Narrative Review.,"Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are well-characterized diseases, they can coexist in a given patient. The term asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) was introduced to describe patients that have clinical features of both diseases and may represent around 25% of COPD patients and around 20% of asthma patients. Despite the increasing interest in ACO, there are still substantial controversies regarding its definition and its position within clinical guidelines for patients with obstructive lung disease. In general, most definitions indicate that ACO patients must present with non-reversible airflow limitation, significant exposure to smoking or other noxious particles or gases, together with features of asthma. In patients with a primary diagnosis of COPD, the identification of ACO has therapeutic implication because the asthmatic component should be treated with inhaled corticosteroids and some studies suggest that the most severe patients may respond to biological agents indicated for severe asthma. This manuscript aims to summarize the current state-of-the-art of ACO. The definitions, prevalence, and clinical manifestations will be reviewed and some innovative aspects, such as genetics, epigenetics, and biomarkers will be addressed. Lastly, the management and prognosis will be outlined as well as the position of ACO in the COPD and asthma guidelines.",2021,respiratory
37468611,Association of World Trade Center (WTC) Occupational Exposure Intensity with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Asthma COPD Overlap (ACO).,"Reported associations between World Trade Center (WTC) occupational exposure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma COPD overlap (ACO) have been inconsistent. Using spirometric case definitions, we examined that association in the largest WTC occupational surveillance cohort. We examined the relation between early arrival at the 2001 WTC disaster site (when dust and fumes exposures were most intense) and COPD and ACO in workers with at least one good quality spirometry with bronchodilator response testing between 2002 and 2019, and no physician-diagnosed COPD before 9/11/2001. COPD was defined spirometrically as fixed airflow obstruction and ACO as airflow obstruction plus an increase of ≥ 400 ml in FEV<sub>1</sub> after bronchodilator administration. We used a nested 1:4 case-control design matching on age, sex and height using incidence density sampling. Of the 17,928 study participants, most were male (85.3%) and overweight or obese (84.9%). Further, 504 (2.8%) and 244 (1.4%) study participants met the COPD and ACO spirometric case definitions, respectively. In multivariable analyses adjusted for smoking, occupation, cohort entry period, high peripheral blood eosinophil count and other covariates, early arrival at the WTC site was associated with both COPD (adjusted odds ratio [OR<sub>adj</sub>] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.78) and ACO (OR<sub>adj</sub> = 1.55, 95%CI 1.04-2.32). In this cohort of WTC workers, WTC exposure intensity was associated with spirometrically defined COPD and ACO. Our findings suggest that early arrival to the WTC site is a risk factor for the development of COPD or of fixed airway obstruction in workers with pre-existing asthma.",2023,respiratory
35524207,Smoking related attention alteration in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-smoking comorbidity.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory disease that causes a wide range of cognitive impairments. Although COPD-Smoking comorbidity is common, the relationship between smoking and cognitive function in COPD-Smoking comorbidity remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of smoking on cognitive function like attention in COPD-Smoking patients. In this study, we used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the effect of smoking on attention in patients with COPD. Behavioral analysis revealed that among patients with COPD the smokers had a shorter course of COPD and showed a worse attention performance than the non-smokers. Resting-state fMRI analysis revealed that among patients with COPD smokers showed lower regional homogeneity (ReHo) value of the fusiform gyrus than non-smokers. Importantly, the ReHo of the fusiform gyrus is positively associated with attention and mediates the effect of smoking on attention in COPD. In summary, our study provides behavioral and neurobiological evidence supporting the positive effect of smoking on attention in COPD. This may be helpful for understanding and treating COPD and even other diseases comorbid with smoking.",2022,respiratory
28298389,Screening for COPD: the gap between logic and evidence.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease leading to further morbidity and significant mortality. The first step for any condition is to make the appropriate diagnosis, and spirometry barriers abound in practice around the world. It is tempting to undertake mass screening on all smokers to detect COPD. While this would pick up cases of COPD, results of studies of its effect on COPD end-points such as exacerbations, hospitalisations and mortality are disappointing. As such, aggressive case finding of COPD by screening for symptoms that patients may not themselves perceive is very important in primary care, with subsequent spirometry defining the diagnosis.We also have to separate out population screening from individual patient interactions. Performing spirometry, even on a truly asymptomatic patient, may allow earlier diagnosis and modification of risk factors such as smoking (mostly) and exacerbation risk. It also recognises patients with early disease who are at high risk of comorbidities such as cardiac illness, such that appropriate treatment strategies can be implemented. Making a diagnosis, and even the fact of worrying about such a diagnosis, can affect the motivational level of the individual patient to cease smoking; all patients should of course be counselled to stop smoking. As such, consider the individual patient in front of you for unrecognised symptoms and therefore unrecognised illness, as making a diagnosis earlier can allow the institution of care, including smoking cessation, vaccination, bronchodilators and comorbidity management.",2017,respiratory
37736149,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Cameroon: Prevalence and Predictors-A Multisetting Community-Based Study.,"Little is known concerning chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where the disease remains underdiagnosed. We aimed to estimate its prevalence in Cameroon and look for its predictors. Adults aged 19 years and older were randomly selected in 4 regions of Cameroon to participate in a cross-sectional community-based study. Data were collected in the participant's home or place of work. Spirometry was performed on selected participants. COPD was defined as the postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC) < lower limit of normal, using the global lung initiative (GLI) equations for Black people. Binomial logistic regression was used to seek COPD-associated factors. The strength of the association was measured using the adjusted odds ratio (aOR). A total of 5055 participants (median age (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentile) = 43 (30-56) years, 54.9% of women) were enrolled. COPD prevalence (95% confidence interval (95% CI)) was 2.9% (2.4, 3.3)%. Independent predictors of COPD (aOR (95% CI)) were a high educational level (4.7 (2.0, 11.1)), living in semiurban or rural locality (1.7 (1.4, 3.0)), tobacco smoking (1.7 (1.1, 2.5)), biomass fuel exposure (1.9 (1.1, 3.3)), experience of dyspnea (2.2 (1.4, 3.5)), history of tuberculosis (3.6 (1.9, 6.7)), and history of asthma (6.3 (3.4, 11.6)). Obesity was protective factor (aOR (95%CI) = 0.3 (0.2, 0.5)). The prevalence of COPD was relatively low.

Sub-Saharan Africa's rapid pace of urbanization, economic expansion, and population growth raise concerns of increasing incidence of NCRDs. This research characterizes the state of research on pollution and NCRDs in the 46 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This research systematically reviewed the literature on studies of asthma; chronic bronchitis; allergic rhinitis; and air pollutants such as particulate matter, ozone, NOx, and sulfuric oxide. We searched three major databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) using the key words ""asthma"", ""chronic bronchitis"", ""allergic rhinitis"", and ""COPD"" with ""carbon monoxide (CO)"", ""sulfuric oxide (SO)"", ""ozone (O3)"", ""nitrogen dioxide (NO2)"", and ""particulate matter (PM)"", restricting the search to the 46 countries that comprise SSA. Only papers published in scholarly journals with a defined health outcome in individuals and which tested associations with explicitly measured or modelled air exposures were considered for inclusion. All candidate papers were entered into a database for review. We found a total of 362 unique research papers in the initial search of the three databases. Among these, 14 met the inclusion criteria. These papers comprised studies from just five countries. Nine papers were from South Africa; two from Malawi; and one each from Ghana, Namibia, and Nigeria. Most studies were cross-sectional. Exposures to ambient air pollutants were measured using spectrometry and chromatography. Some studies created composite measures of air pollution using a range of data layers. NCRD outcomes were measured by self-reported health status and measures of lung function (spirometry). Populations of interest were primarily schoolchildren, though a few studies focused on secondary school students and adults. The paucity of research on NCRDs and ambient air pollutant exposures is pronounced within the African continent. While capacity to measure air quality in SSA is high, studies targeting NCRDs should work to draw attention to questions of outdoor air pollution and health. As the climate changes and SSA economies expand and countries urbanize, these questions will become increasingly important.",2022,respiratory
38022824,Factors Associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Hospital-Based Case-Control Study.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this paper, we determined risk factors for COPD among patients presenting to pulmonology and medical outpatients' clinics of Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH). In this case-control study, cases were patients with COPD confirmed by spirometry and controls were those with normal spirometry. The two groups were matched by age and gender. We enrolled 123 participants, of whom 41 were cases and 82 controls. A total of 51 women (41.5%) and 72 men (58.5%), of whom 25 were male cases (61%) and 47 were male controls (57%), were included. The results of our study suggest that the variables associated with the presence of COPD among participants attending MRRH were a history of having ever smoked and a prior history of atopy. This brings to our attention the fact that smoking remains a major risk factor for COPD in this setting, just as it is in developed countries. Our study has shown that the factors associated with COPD are smoking and a history of atopy. Patients with a history of asthma and tuberculosis are also probably more likely to develop COPD than those without similar disease conditions.",2023,respiratory
26452126,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and its Non-Smoking Risk Factors in India.,"The rising prevalence of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is generally attributed to smoking, since the role of other risk factors among non-smokers are not well established especially in low and middle income countries like India. This is also reflected by the limited literature available on non-smoking related COPD risk factors like indoor and outdoor air pollution. The present review is an attempt to assess the influence of non-smoking risk factors on COPD and its measures in Indian subcontinent. The most noteworthy factors among non-smokers appear to be the use of biomass fuel for cooking and heating purposes. We observed that the studies undertaken to evaluate the role of such risk factors are inconclusive due to weak methodologies and small sample sizes, may be due to limited financial resources. The present review suggests the need of a nationally representative study to estimate the effect of each of the potential modifiable risk factor (other than smoking) for framing impactful public health policies to prevent and manage COPD at community and population level in India.",2016,respiratory
26964078,The lung microbiome and exacerbations of COPD.,"Traditional culture methods have identified airway bacterial pathogens that cause acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and contribute to airway inflammation and COPD progression. However, conventional microbiology is limited by low sensitivity and bias toward predetermined and predominant pathogens. Highly sensitive, unbiased microbiome techniques overcome these limitations. Here, we present recent lung microbiome data, specifically in the context of smoking, COPD, and exacerbations. In contrast to the sterile lung environment found with conventional microbiology, microbiome techniques demonstrate a lower respiratory tract microbiome in health. Alterations in the lung microbiome with smoking and COPD have been clearly demonstrated by culture techniques, however, the findings in microbiome studies are limited and controversial. Increasing COPD disease severity is associated with a reduction in microbial diversity. Though microbial community structure does not change with exacerbation, there are notable changes in its composition. Antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD have significant but opposing effects on microbiome composition. The composition of the lung microbiome changes with smoking, the severity of COPD, during acute exacerbations and with the use of steroids and/or antibiotics. Understanding the role of the microbiome in disease progression and development of exacerbations will lead to novel therapies.",2016,respiratory

Taking sub-Saharan Africa as an example, in rural areas, COPD is even unknown regarding public awareness and public health planning. Programs for the management of COPD are poorly developed, and the quality of care is often of a low standard. Inhaled medication is often not available or not affordable. Tobacco smoking is the most common encountered risk factor for COPD. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, household air pollution is another major risk factor for the development of COPD. Communities are also exposed to a variety of other risk factors, such as low birth weight, malnutrition, severe childhood respiratory infections, occupational exposures, outdoor pollution, human-immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis. All these factors contribute to the high burden of poor respiratory health in sub-Saharan Africa. Expert commentary: A silent growing epidemic of COPD seems to be unravelling.

34969348,Pulmonary translocation of ultrafine carbon particles in COPD and IPF patients.,"Epidemiological studies indicate association between elevated air pollution and adverse health effects. Several mechanisms have been suggested, including translocation of inhaled ultrafine carbon (UFC) particles into the bloodstream. Previous studies in healthy subjects have shown no significant pulmonary translocation of UFC-particles. This study aimed to assess if UFC-particles translocate from damaged alveolar compartment in subjects suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Eleven COPD and nine IPF subjects were exposed to a 100 nm UFC-particle-aerosol labeled with Indium-111. Activity in the body was followed up for 10 days using gamma camera planar-imaging as well as in blood and urine samples. The pulmonary central to periphery activity ratio was significantly higher for COPD as compared to IPF subjects at exposure, 1.8 and 1.4, respectively and remained constant throughout the test period. Ten days after exposure, the estimated median pulmonary translocation of UFC particles was 22.8 and 25.8% for COPD and IPF, respectively. Bound activity was present in blood throughout the test period, peaking at 24-h postinhalation with a median concentration of 5.6 and 8.9 Bq/ml for the COPD and IPF, respectively. Median bound activity excreted in urine (% of inhaled) after 10 days was 1.4% in COPD and 0.7% in IPF. Activity accumulation in liver and spleen could not be demonstrated. Our results suggest that UFC particles leak through the damaged alveolar barrier to the bloodstream in COPD and IPF patients probably distributing in a wide spectrum of whole-body tissues.",2022,respiratory

However, the impact of a comprehensive healthy lifestyle as a potential mediator between SES and COPD risk remains understudied. This study analyzed data from 32,836 US adults in the NHANES (1999-2020) and 131,872 UK adults in the UK Biobank. SES was assessed via latent class analysis based on income, education, employment, and health insurance (NHANES). SES was categorized into high, middle, and low levels. Healthy lifestyle scores included nonsmoking, no heavy drinking, regular physical activity, and a high-quality diet. Weighted multivariable logistic regression (NHANES) and Cox proportional hazards models (UK Biobank) were used to assess the associations between SES and the prevalence (NHANES) or incidence (UK Biobank) of COPD. In the UK Biobank, the incidences of newly diagnosed COPD in the high-, medium-, and low-SES groups were 1.27%, 2.92%, and 6.57%, respectively. In the U.S. NHANES, the prevalence rates of COPD were 2.55%, 2.53%, and 4.50%, respectively. Compared with the highest SES group, a low SES was a risk factor for both the incidence and prevalence of COPD (UK Biobank: HR = 3.27, 95% CI = 2.98 to 3.58; NHANES: OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.23 to 2.10). The percentages of the mediation effect of a healthy lifestyle in the UK Biobank and US NHANES were 2.81% and 37.27%, respectively. Additionally, compared with those in the group with the highest SES and the healthiest lifestyle, the risk of COPD incidence and prevalence increased by 950% (HR = 10.50, 95% CI = 9.04 to 12.20) and 641% (OR = 7.41, 95% CI = 5.10 to 10.78), respectively, in the group with the lowest SES and the unhealthiest lifestyle. Risk factor analysis for COPD revealed that, in addition to a low SES (HR = 2.55, 95% CI = 2.39 to 2.72; OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.76 to 2.46) and unhealthy lifestyle (HR = 2.92, 95% CI = 2.73 to 3.12; OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 3.13 to 4.57), smoking (HR = 5.23, 95% CI = 4.87 to 5.61; OR = 3.85, 95% CI = 3.23 to 4.59) was the most significant risk factor for COPD. Low SES significantly contributes to COPD risk, but a healthy lifestyle mediating this association. Promoting healthy lifestyle choices and addressing socioeconomic disparities are essential public health strategies for COPD prevention. Additionally, smoking cessation and increased early screening in smokers are strongly recommended.",2025,respiratory
39133529,"Chronic Airflow Limitation, Emphysema, and Impaired Diffusing Capacity in Relation to Smoking Habits in a Swedish Middle-aged Population.","<b>Rationale:</b> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes respiratory symptoms and chronic airflow limitation (CAL). In some cases, emphysema and impaired diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dl<sub>CO</sub>) are present, but characteristics and symptoms vary with smoking exposure. <b>Objective:</b> To study the prevalence of CAL, emphysema, and impaired Dl<sub>CO</sub> in relation to smoking and respiratory symptoms in a middle-aged population. <b>Methods:</b> We investigated 28,746 randomly invited individuals (52% women) aged 50-64 years across six Swedish sites. We performed spirometry, Dl<sub>CO</sub> testing, and high-resolution computed tomography and asked for smoking habits and respiratory symptoms. CAL was defined as post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second divided by forced vital capacity (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC) < 0.7. <b>Results:</b> The overall prevalence was 8.8% for CAL, 5.7% for impaired Dl<sub>CO</sub> (Dl<sub>CO</sub> < LLN), and 8.8% for emphysema, with a higher prevalence in current smokers than in ex-smokers and never-smokers. The proportion of never-smokers among those with CAL, emphysema, and impaired Dl<sub>CO</sub> was 32%, 19%, and 31%, respectively. Regardless of smoking habits, the prevalence of respiratory symptoms was higher among people with CAL and impaired Dl<sub>CO</sub> than those with normal lung function. Asthma prevalence in never-smokers with CAL was 14%. In this group, asthma was associated with lower FEV<sub>1</sub> and more respiratory symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> In this large population-based study of middle-aged people, CAL and impaired Dl<sub>CO</sub> were associated with common respiratory symptoms. Self-reported asthma was not associated with CAL in never-smokers. Our findings suggest that CAL in never-smokers signifies a separate clinical phenotype that may be monitored and, possibly, treated differently from smoking-related COPD.",2024,respiratory
28260876,Heterogeneity of asthma-COPD overlap syndrome.,"Many patients suffering from asthma or COPD have overlapping features of both diseases. However, a phenotypical approach for evaluating asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) has not been established. In this report, we examined the phenotypes in patients with ACOS. Patients diagnosed with ACOS between 2011 and 2015 were identified and classified into four phenotype groups. Group A was composed of patients who smoked <10 pack years and had blood eosinophil counts ≥300. Group B was composed of patients who smoked <10 pack years and had blood eosinophil counts <300. Group C was composed of patients who smoked ≥10 pack years and had blood eosinophil counts ≥300. Group D was composed of patients who smoked <10 pack years and had blood eosinophil counts <300. Clinical characteristics were analyzed and compared among groups. Comparisons were made among 103 ACOS patients. Patients in group D were oldest, while patients in group A were youngest. There were relatively more female patients in groups A and B; the majority of patients in groups C and D were male. The degree of airflow obstruction was most severe in group C. The rate of being free of severe exacerbation was significantly lower in group C than in the other groups. In this study, each ACOS phenotype showed different characteristics. The proportion of patients free of severe exacerbation differed significantly among groups. At this time, further studies on the phenotypes of ACOS are required.",2017,respiratory
29138548,E-cigarettes in patients with COPD: current perspectives.,"Conventional cigarette smoking is known to result in significant COPD morbidity and mortality. Strategies to reduce and/or stop smoking in this highly vulnerable patient group are key public health priorities to reduce COPD morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, smoking cessation efforts in patients with COPD are poor and there is a compelling need for more efficient approaches to cessation for patients with COPD. Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are devices that use batteries to vaporize nicotine. They may facilitate quit attempts and cessation in many smokers. Although they are not risk free, ECs are much less harmful than tobacco smoking. Hence, the use of ECs in vulnerable groups and in patients with challenges to abstain or multiple relapses to this habit may be promising. To date, little is known about health consequences of EC use among COPD smokers and whether their regular use has any effects on subjective and objective COPD outcomes. In the current review, we discuss the current perspectives and literature on the role of ECs in abstaining from conventional smoking and the effects of ECs on the respiratory tract in patients with COPD.",2017,respiratory
40410778,Clinical characteristic of patients with COPD-A.,"The 2023 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) document proposed the COPD-A subtype as a condition of COPD with asthma. We examined the characteristics of COPD-A patients and analyzed them according to smoking history and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use. Patients in the COPD cohort with a history of asthma were included. The patients were divided into two groups according to their smoking history (< 10 vs. ≥10 pack-years) and their clinical characteristics were compared. The association between patients' ICS use and the occurrence for exacerbations during 1 year follow-up period was analyzed. Of the 970 patients included in the analysis, the group with a smoking history less than 10 pack-years (n = 158) had a significantly higher BMI, FEV<sub>1</sub> (%), FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC (%), DLco, ESR, and prevalence of osteoporosis. Among 560 patients who were followed up for 1 year, the patients with ICS (n = 274) had a higher exacerbation rate than without ICS (n = 286) (54% vs. 44.1%, p = 0.018). However, in multivariable analysis, ICS use was not significantly associated with exacerbation. In subgroup analysis of patients with blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/µl, ICS use showed a trend to reduce the risk for exacerbation (IRR = 0.907, p = 0.708). In patients with blood eosinophil count < 300 cells/µl, ICS use significantly increased the risk for exacerbation (IRR = 1.547, p = 0.005). COPD-A patients with a smoking history of less than 10 pack-years had better pulmonary function test results, BMI, ESR, and prevalence of osteoporosis.

38377392,Lysophospholipid Acyltransferase 9 Promotes Emphysema Formation via Platelet-activating Factor.,"Cigarette smoking is known to be the leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the detailed mechanisms have not been elucidated. PAF (platelet-activating factor), a potent inflammatory mediator, is involved in the pathogenesis of various respiratory diseases such as bronchial asthma and COPD. We focused on LPLAT9 (lysophospholipid acyltransferase 9), a biosynthetic enzyme of PAF, in the pathogenesis of COPD. LPLAT9 gene expression was observed in excised COPD lungs and single-cell RNA sequencing data of alveolar macrophages (AMs). LPLAT9 was predominant and upregulated in AMs, particularly monocyte-derived AMs, in patients with COPD. To identify the function of LPLAT9/PAF in AMs in the pathogenesis of COPD, we exposed systemic LPLAT9-knockout (LPALT9<sup>-/-</sup>) mice to cigarette smoke (CS). CS increased the number of AMs, especially the monocyte-derived fraction, which secreted MMP12 (matrix metalloprotease 12). Also, CS augmented LPLAT9 phosphorylation/activation on macrophages and, subsequently, PAF synthesis in the lung. The LPLAT9<sup>-/-</sup> mouse lung showed reduced PAF production after CS exposure. Intratracheal PAF administration accumulated AMs by increasing MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1). After CS exposure, AM accumulation and subsequent pulmonary emphysema, a primary pathologic change of COPD, were reduced in LPALT9<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with LPLAT9<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Notably, these phenotypes were again worsened by LPLAT9<sup>+/+</sup> bone marrow transplantation in LPALT9<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Thus, CS-induced LPLAT9 activation in monocyte-derived AMs aggravated pulmonary emphysema via PAF-induced further accumulation of AMs. These results suggest that PAF synthesized by LPLAT9 has an important role in the pathogenesis of COPD.",2024,respiratory

36270155,Early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Associations of two spirometry criteria with clinical features.,"Two spirometry criteria have been proposed for early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in young smokers: 1) forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>)/forced vital capacity (FVC) < the lower limit of normal (LLN), and 2) FEV<sub>1</sub> decline ≥60 ml/year. These criteria have yet to be validated. This study explored clinical factors associated with these two spirometry criteria. This retrospective study analysed medical check-up data from 13,010 consecutive subjects aged <50 years who underwent current and 3 previous spirometry tests in Japan. Current ≥10 pack-year smokers were the main focus of analysis; those meeting one or more spirometry criteria were diagnosed with early COPD. Early COPD was categorized into three subtypes: FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC < LLN and FEV<sub>1</sub> decline <60 ml/year (type 1), FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ≥ LLN and FEV<sub>1</sub> decline ≥60 ml/year (type 2), and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC < LLN and FEV<sub>1</sub> decline ≥60 ml/year (type 3). Of the 1579 current ≥ 10 pack-year smokers, 488 (30.9%) met the early COPD criteria. Multivariate multinomial logistic models adjusted for age, sex, height, body mass index (BMI) and smoking history indicated that past BMI increase and low exercise were associated with higher type 2 early COPD incidence (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 4.30 [3.10, 6.04], and 0.80 [0.69, 0.93], respectively) but not with higher type 1 incidence. A history of asthma was associated with higher type 3 incidence (OR [95% CI] = 1.98 [1.18, 3.07]). The 3 types of spirometry-based early COPD have different clinical factors.

40043502,The effect of long-term exposure to a mixture of air pollutants on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major global cause of morbidity and mortality; however, evidence on the effects of air pollutant mixtures on COPD remains limited. This study assessed the impact of long-term exposure to multiple pollutants on COPD prevalence and identified vulnerable subgroups. We analyzed Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2010-2017) data linked to 5-year moving average concentrations of CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, PM₂.₅, and PM₁₀. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) estimated the combined effects of pollutants on COPD prevalence, with subgroup analyses performed according to sex, smoking status, and airflow limitation. Adjustments included age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and household income. Among 21,804 participants, 3515 had COPD. BKMR analysis showed that long-term exposure to a pollutant mixture was associated with increased COPD prevalence. O₃ and NO₂ were identified as the most influential pollutants (posterior inclusion probabilities > 0.50). Further analysis showed a significant increase in COPD risk with higher NO₂ and O₃ concentrations, particularly when other pollutants were at lower or median levels. Significant interactions were observed, particularly between SO₂ and CO, CO and O₃, and NO₂ and O₃. Subgroup analyses identified vulnerable populations, indicating stronger associations among females and never smokers and more pronounced effects in individuals with GOLD 2-4. These findings suggest that long-term exposure to multiple air pollutants could increase COPD risk, particularly for females, never smokers, and individuals with more severe COPD. Targeted interventions and policy measures are needed to reduce exposure, especially for these at-risk populations.",2025,respiratory

Although adequate evidence for the relation of ambient air pollution, including the presence of particulate matter (PM2.5), with the development of COPD is lacking, higher mortality from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases has been reported among patients exposed to air pollution for a long time. In addition, several reports have pointed out the possibility that acute exacerbation of COPD can be caused by short-term exposure to air pollution.

This study aimed to systematically summarize the evidence from MR studies on the impact of comorbidities on COPD. Systematic review and meta-analysis of MR studies. Eight electronic databases were searched to identify relevant MR studies about comorbidities associated with COPD from inception to June 3, 2024. Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology-Mendelian Randomization (STROBE-MR) guidelines were used for reporting quality assessment. We used either a random-effects model or a fixed-effects model to estimate pooled causal evidence from MR studies of comorbidities and COPD. A total of 26 studies were included, of which 8, 4, and 3 studies summarized the causal effects of GERD, depression, obesity on the risk of COPD, respectively. Overall, the studies included had high reporting quality. Our meta-analysis using inverse variance weighted (IVW) of main MR analyses revealed positive causal effects of GERD (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.47-1.84), depression (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.01-1.71), and obesity (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.25-1.83) on COPD.

Respondents who were ever cigarette smokers were asked when they began smoking regularly. Multivariable analysis assessed self-report of COPD diagnosis as a function of age started smoking (<15 yr vs. ⩾15 yr) adjusting for current smoking, cigarette pack-years, and covariates. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Overall, 7.1% reported that they had COPD, 2.6% for never-smokers compared with 23.1% and 11.6% for smoking onset <15 and ⩾15 years, respectively. Persons who began smoking regularly at <15 years of age had higher pack-years of smoking (median, 29 vs. 15, respectively), and higher smoking intensity (median, 20 cigarettes/d for <15 yr vs. 10 cigarettes/d for ⩾15 yr for current smokers). In the multivariable analysis, the relative risk for COPD among childhood smokers was 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 1.22-1.63) compared with later-onset smokers. Substituting smoking duration for pack-years confounded the association between current smoking and COPD but did not change the childhood smoking estimate. In a stratified analysis, higher risk for childhood smoking was found at all current smoking intensity levels. <b>Conclusions:</b> Among adults aged ⩾40 years, one-fifth of childhood smokers have COPD. Lifetime cigarette smoking explained some but not all of the higher risk. If replicated, this suggests a lung development window of enhanced vulnerability to cigarette smoking.",2023,respiratory
39759460,Investigation of Smoking Cessation Status and Its Influencing Factors in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease with high prevalence, high mortality and high costs across the globe. Small airways are major sites contributing to airway resistance and the small airway disorder (SAD) is frequently implicated in early-stage COPD. Smoking is recognized as the leading cause of COPD and SAD. This study aimed to investigate the status quo and influencing factors of smoking cessation in patients with SAD or COPD, which is crucial for improving prevention and treatment of chronic airway diseases. In this multicenter, prospective cohort investigation, questionnaire survey and one-year follow-up study were conducted in SAD and COPD patients with smoking history. The rate of quitting intention, quitting attempt and recent smoking cessation of SAD or different stages of COPD and their influencing factors were recorded, compared and analyzed. A total of 386 valid questionnaires were collected. The rate of quitting intention was 91.7% (95% CI: 88.53-94.07%), and quitting attempt was 73.6% (95% CI: 68.96-77.73%). Regular bronchodilator use, alcohol abstinence, and the lower Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) scores were associated with a higher intention to quit smoking. Further, inpatients with higher mMRC scores, non-smoking parents, engagement in pulmonary rehabilitation exercises, and receipt of medical advice to quit were more likely to attempt quitting smoking. In the one-year follow-up survey, the overall recent smoking cessation rate was 23.9%. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that higher mMRC grade, carrying out pulmonary rehabilitation exercise and the quitting intention were positive factors for quitting smoking, while outpatients with lower educational level, higher FTND score and Tobacco Craving Questionnaire-Short Form (TCQ-SF) scores were negative influencing factors for recent smoking cessation. Patients with SAD and COPD generally had a high willingness to quit smoking, but a significant reduction in the success rate of smoking cessation.

We investigated differences in clinical characteristics between smoking and non-smoking COPD patients. We used data from the Korea COPD Subgroup Study (KOCOSS) database, which is a multicenter cohort that recruits patients from 54 medical centres in Korea. Comprehensive comparisons of smoking and non-smoking COPD patients were performed based on general characteristics, exacerbations, symptom scores, radiological findings, and lung-function tests. Of the 2477 patients included in the study, 8.1% were non-smokers and 91.9% were smokers. Non-smoking COPD patients were more likely to be female and to have a higher body mass index and lower level of education. Non-smoking COPD patients had more comorbidities, including hypertension, osteoporosis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, and experienced more respiratory and allergic diseases. No significant differences in exacerbation rates, symptom scores, or exercise capacity scores were observed between the two groups. Smoking COPD patients had more emphysematous lung according to the radiological findings, and non-smoking patients had more tuberculosis-destroyed lung and bronchiectasis. Lung-function testing revealed no significant difference in the forced expiratory capacity in 1 sec between the two groups, but smokers had more rapid lung-function decline in the 5 years of follow-up data. We found differences in general characteristics and radiological findings between smoking and non-smoking COPD patients. No significant differences in exacerbation or symptom scores were observed, but decline in lung function was less steep in non-smoking patients.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2022.2053088 .",2022,respiratory

SCFA concentrations were measured in human plasma, comparing non-smokers (n = 6) and smokers (n = 12). Using a mouse COPD model induced by cigarette smoke exposure or elastase-induced emphysema, we modulated SCFA levels through dietary interventions and antibiotics to evaluate their effects on inflammation and alveolar destruction. Human smokers showed lower plasma SCFA concentrations than non-smokers, with plasma propionic acid positively correlating with forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity. Three-month smoking-exposed mice demonstrated altered gut microbiota and significantly reduced fecal SCFA concentrations compared to air-exposed controls. In these mice, a high-fiber diet increased fecal SCFAs and mitigated inflammation and alveolar destruction, while antibiotics decreased fecal SCFAs and exacerbated disease features. However, in the elastase-induced model, fecal SCFA concentration remained unchanged, and high-fiber diet or antibiotic interventions had no significant effect. These findings suggest that smoking exposure alters gut microbiota and SCFA production through its systemic effects. The anti-inflammatory properties of SCFAs may play a role in COPD pathogenesis, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets.",2025,respiratory

Early studies looking at airway diseases gave some contradictory results. The purpose of our study was to determine global variation in studies in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the prevalence of COPD and asthma; and to determine whether the presence of asthma or COPD affected mortality in the same hospital population. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature of COPD and asthma as co-morbidities in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was performed, looking firstly at the prevalence of these diseases in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and secondly at the relative risk of death from any cause for patients with asthma or COPD. Prevalence of both airway diseases varied markedly by region, making meaningful pooled global estimates of prevalence invalid and not of clinical utility. For individual studies, the interquartile range for asthma prevalence was 4.21 to 12.39%, and for COPD, 3.82 to 11.85%. The relative risk of death with COPD for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was 1.863 (95% CI 1.640-2.115), while the risk with asthma was 0.918 (95% CI 0.767 to 1.098) with no evidence of increased mortality. For asthma and COPD, prevalence in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 varies markedly by region. We found no evidence that asthma predisposed to increased mortality in COVID-19 disease.

37500327,Tobacco Patterns and Risk of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Results From a Cross-Sectional Study.,"There is still uncertainty about which aspects of cigarette smoking influence the risk of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The aim of this study was to estimate the COPD risk as related to duration of use, intensity of use, lifetime tobacco consumption, age of smoking initiation and years of abstinence. We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study based on data from the EPISCAN-II study (n=9092). All participants underwent a face-to-face interview and post-bronchodilator spirometry was performed. COPD was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC<70%. Parametric and nonparametric logistic regression models with generalized additive models were used. 8819 persons were included; 858 with COPD and 7961 without COPD. The COPD risk increased with smoking duration up to ≥50 years [OR 3.5 (95% CI: 2.3-5.4)], with smoking intensity up to ≥39cig/day [OR 10.1 (95% CI: 5.3-18.4)] and with lifetime tobacco consumption up to >29 pack-years [OR 3.8 (95% CI: 3.1-4.8)]. The COPD risk for those who started smoking at 22 or later was 0.9 (95% CI: 0.6-1.4). The risk of COPD decreased with increasing years of cessation. In comparison with both never smokers and current smokers, the lowest risk of COPD was found after 15-25 years of abstinence. COPD risk increases with duration, intensity, and lifetime tobacco consumption and decreases importantly with years of abstinence. Age at smoking initiation shows no effect. After 15-25 years of cessation, COPD risk could be equal to that of a never smoker. This work suggests that the time it takes to develop COPD in a smoker is about 30 years.",2023,respiratory

Noninvasive ventilation also offers benefit for patients with COPD and with accompanying pneumonia or with hypercapnic respiratory failure in postextubation, postoperative, and do not intubate settings. Noninvasive ventilation, in addition, offers benefit in other forms of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, including those caused by asthma, cystic fibrosis, and obesity hypoventilation. A newer form of noninvasive ventilatory assistance, high-flow nasal cannula, has emerged in recent years as a technique to not only oxygenate effectively but also to improve ventilatory efficiency and reduce the work of breathing in patients with severe COPD.

COPD was primarily defined as an FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio <0.70 and secondarily as the ratio less than the lower limit of normal (LLN). The prevalence of COPD in the 1656 never-smokers who completed the study was 10.5% (95% CI: 9.1-12.1%) [ratio<LLN 4.6%]. The likelihood of having COPD increased with advancing age [odds ratio (OR) 4.11 in those 60-69 years and OR 8.73 in those 70 years and older], having attained up to 12 years of education (OR 1.75) compared to those with more than 12 years, having a history of asthma (OR 2.30), childhood hospitalization due to breathing problems before age 10 years (OR 2.50), or having a family history of respiratory diseases (OR 2.70). Being overweight or obese was associated with reduced prevalence of COPD compared with being normal weight. In males and females, advanced age, a history of asthma, and childhood breathing problems before age 10 were factors that elevated the likelihood of COPD. However, in males, additional factors such as a higher body mass index and a family history of respiratory diseases also contributed to increased odds of COPD. COPD was prevalent in this population of never-smokers aged 40 years and over.

Although studies over the last 30 years helped reduce the values, it is not very clear if the current air quality guidelines are adequately protective for COPD sufferers. This systematic review was to summarize the up-to-date literature on the impact of air pollution on the COPD sufferers.

We also used the articles in the reference lists of the identified articles. Both short-term and long-term exposures to outdoor air pollution around the world are associated with the mortality and morbidity of COPD sufferers even at levels below the current air quality guidelines. Biomass cooking in low-income countries was clearly associated with COPD morbidity in adult nonsmoking females. There is a need to continue to improve the air quality guidelines. A range of intervention measures could be selected at different levels based on countries' socioeconomic conditions to reduce the air pollution exposure and COPD burden.",2016,respiratory
40236760,Risk and Protective Factors of COPD Among Smokers: A Cross-Sectional Study Using NHANES Database.,"Smoking plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), underscoring the importance of smoking cessation. Nevertheless, not all smokers who do not quit will necessarily develop COPD. This study aimed to examine the risk and protective factors associated with COPD among individuals who smoke. The study included a cohort of 2619 adult smokers with lung function data, whose demographic characteristics, health status, lifestyle behaviors, and dietary patterns were examined using T-tests, Chi-square tests, and logical analysis. Among the study participants, 441 individuals were identified as having COPD by analyzing pulmonary function data. Advanced age (p<0.001), low body mass index (BMI, p<0.001), ethnicity (p=0.019), and comorbid asthma (p<0.001) were found to be statistically correlated with the presence of COPD. Additionally, a higher intake of fruits and vegetables (p=0.026) was shown to have a beneficial impact. After considering factors related to type 2 inflammation, nutrient intake from vegetables and fruits, and other variables, it was observed that vitamin C (p<0.001) exhibited a protective effect against COPD in smokers. Additionally, advanced age (p<0.001), low BMI (p<0.001), comorbid asthma (p<0.001), and higher consumption of fruits and vegetables (p=0.032) remained significant independent risk factors for COPD in smokers. Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed that COPD patients who consumed fewer fruits and vegetables had lower levels of vitamin C intake (p=0.004). The findings of our study suggest that smokers who are older, have a lower BMI, and comorbid asthma are at an increased risk of developing COPD. Conversely, higher consumption of fruits and vegetables, as well as increased intake of vitamin C, may help reduce this risk. Additionally, our results indicate that among smokers with lower fruit and vegetable intake, COPD patients tend to have lower levels of vitamin C consumption.",2025,respiratory
30962144,Association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and PM2.5 in Taiwanese nonsmokers.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Not much is known regarding the influence of non-smoking-related risk factors on COPD in Taiwan. We examined the relationship between exposure to particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and COPD among nonsmokers in Taiwan. This population-based study involved 3941 nonsmoking Taiwanese adults who were recruited in the Taiwan Biobank project between 2008 and 2015. Air pollution data between 2006 and 2011 were obtained from the air quality monitoring database (AQMD). COPD was the outcome of interest and was identified using the National health insurance Research Database (NHIRD). The data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression models. Compared with the lowest quartile (PM<sub>2.5</sub> = 29.38), exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the highest quartile (>38.98 μg/m<sup>3</sup>) was significantly associated with COPD (OR, 1.29; CI 1.01-1.65) after multivariate adjustments. However, exposures to concentrations of 32.07-38.98 μg/m<sup>3</sup> (OR, 1.12 CI 0.88-1.44) and 29.38-32.07 μg/m<sup>3</sup> (OR, 1.09 CI 0.84-1.41) showed positive but non-significant associations. However, the test for trend was significant (Ptrend = 0.043). The ORs for exposure to sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and NOx (nitrogen monoxide (NO were not significant. Based on our data, exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> at concentrations greater than 38.98 μg/m<sup>3</sup> increased susceptibility to COPD among Taiwanese nonsmokers. Combatting COPD would involve integrating tobacco control and pollution management strategies.",2019,respiratory
32904646,Association Between Systemic and Pulmonary Vascular Dysfunction in COPD.,"In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), endothelial dysfunction and stiffness of systemic arteries may contribute to increased cardiovascular risk. Pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) is frequent in COPD. The association between PVD and systemic vascular dysfunction has not been thoroughly evaluated in COPD. A total of 108 subjects were allocated into four groups (non-smoking controls, smoking controls, COPD without PVD and COPD with PVD). In systemic arteries, endothelial dysfunction was assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and arterial stiffness by pulse wave analysis (PWA) and pulse wave velocity (PWV). PVD was defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) ≥25 mmHg at right heart catheterization or by a tricuspid regurgitation velocity >2.8 m/s at doppler echocardiography. Biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial damage were assessed in peripheral blood. FMD was lower in COPD patients, with or without PVD, compared to non-smoking controls; and in patients with COPD and PVD compared to smoking controls. PWV was higher in COPD with PVD patients compared to both non-smoking and smoking controls in a model adjusted by age and the Framingham score; PWV was also higher in patients with COPD and PVD compared to COPD without PVD patients in the non-adjusted analysis. FMD and PWV correlated significantly with forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DL<sub>CO</sub>) and systolic PAP. FMD and PWV were correlated in all subjects. We conclude that endothelial dysfunction of systemic arteries is common in COPD, irrespective if they have PVD or not. COPD patients with PVD show increased stiffness and greater impairment of endothelial function in systemic arteries. These findings suggest the association of vascular impairment in both pulmonary and systemic territories in a subset of COPD patients.",2020,respiratory
35361214,Association of air pollution exposure with exercise-induced oxygen desaturation in COPD.,"There is a link between exposure to air pollution and the increased prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and declining pulmonary function, but the association with O<sub>2</sub> desaturation during exercise in COPD patients with emphysema is unclear. Our aims were to estimate the prevalence of O<sub>2</sub> desaturation during exercise in patients with COPD, and determine the association of exposure to air pollution with exercise-induced desaturation (EID), the degree of emphysema, and dynamic hyperinflation (DH). We assessed the effects of 10-year prior to the HRCT assessment and 7 days prior to the six-minute walking test exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of < 10 µm (PM<sub>10</sub>) or of < 2.5 µM (PM<sub>2.5)</sub>, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in patients with emphysema in this retrospective cohort study. EID was defined as a nadir standard pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) level of < 90% or a delta (△)SpO<sub>2</sub> level of ≥ 4%. Ambient air pollutant (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>) data were obtained from Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) air-monitoring stations, usually within 10 km to each participant's home address. We recruited 141 subjects with emphysema. 41.1% of patients with emphysema exhibited EID, and patients with EID had more dyspnea, worse lung function, more severe emphysema, more frequent acute exacerbations, managed a shorter walking distance, had DH, and greater long-term exposure to air pollution than those without EID. We observed that levels of 10-year concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> were significantly associated with EID, PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were associated with the severity of emphysema, and associated with DH in patients with emphysema. In contrast, short-term exposure did not have any effect on patients. Long-term exposure to ambient PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>, but not O<sub>3</sub>, was associated with EID.",2022,respiratory
29767222,Mortality in Asthma-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Overlap in the United States.,"Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) is recognized increasingly as a distinct clinical entity and is associated with higher comorbidities compared with patients with asthma and COPD alone. Little is known about the leading causes of death related to ACO in the US general population, however. Our aim was to define the causes of mortality among patients with ACO compared with asthma and COPD in the US population. We examined questions using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III database linked to the National Death Index. The data from 4434 participants were stratified into 4 groups, those with asthma, COPD, ACO, and those without any obstructive lung disease. We examined baseline demographics and used multivariate logistic regression to model the impact of demographics, smoking, and self-reported, physician-diagnosed lung disease on mortality generating odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs). Among 4434 participants, 120 (2.7%), 340 (7.6%), and 126 (2.8%) participants self-reported diagnoses of asthma, COPD, and ACO syndrome, respectively. Patients with COPD were older (69.7 ± 10.9 years) than other groups. Cardiovascular disease, malignancy, and chronic lower respiratory disease were frequent causes of death. The mortality rates for cardiovascular disease and malignancy were not significantly different among respiratory disease categories. Deaths resulting from chronic respiratory disease were higher in the ACO group (OR 4.9, 95% CI 2.5-9.4) and the COPD group (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.4) when compared with those without obstructive lung disease (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). Although cardiovascular- and malignancy-related deaths are common, a higher proportion of mortality in ACO and COPD is attributed to chronic lung disease.",2018,respiratory
29752708,Coexistence of Chronic Bronchitis in Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease.,"The incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is on the rise worldwide. Chronic bronchitis is a frequent accompaniment of COPD, which increases the burden of COPD in affected individuals. The aim of this study was to characterize the phenotype of chronic bronchitis in COPD patients. The study was based on the survey data retrospectively retrieved from the Action Health-Lung Cancer Prophylaxis and Health Care Improvement screening program that concerned all the inhabitants, aged over 40, of the Proszowice administrative region situated in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship in southern Poland. Participants with the symptoms suggestive of a lung disease were subject to further evaluation. The findings were that 546 (13.3%) out of the 4105 individuals displayed spirometry features of COPD. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis were present in 92 (16.8%) out of the COPD afflicted persons. Chronic bronchitis was commoner in current smokers and its incidence increased with increasing severity of airway obstruction. In multivariate analysis, chronic bronchitis was independently related to lower FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, and to dyspnea. In regression model, factors related to increased risk of chronic bronchitis were current smoking, asthma, and lower lung function. We conclude that COPD with coexisting chronic bronchitis is linked to severer dyspnea and worse lung function. Current smoking, asthma, and lower lung function are related to increased risk of chronic bronchitis accompanying COPD.",2018,respiratory
28325523,Total management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.,"Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) often have multiple comorbid conditions that may interact with each other, confound the choice of treatments, and reduce mortality. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most important comorbidities of CVD, which causes serious consequences in patients with ischemic heart disease, stroke, arrhythmia, and heart failure. COPD shares common risk factors such as tobacco smoking and aging with CVD, is associated with less physical activity, and produces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Overall, patients with COPD have a 2-3-fold increased risk of CVD as compared to age-matched controls when adjusted for tobacco smoking. Chronic heart failure (HF) is a frequent and important comorbidity which has a significant impact on prognosis in COPD, and vice versa. HF overlaps in symptoms and signs and has a common comorbidity with COPD, so that diagnosis of COPD is difficult in patients with HF. The combination of HF and COPD presents many therapeutic challenges including beta-blockers (BBs) and beta-agonists. Inhaled long-acting bronchodilators including beta2-agonists and anticholinergics for COPD would not worsen HF. Diuretics are relatively safe, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are preferred to treat HF accompanied with COPD. BBs are only relatively contraindicated in asthma, but not in COPD. Low doses of cardioselective BBs should be aggressively initiated in clinically stable patients with HF accompanied with COPD combined with close monitoring for signs of airway obstruction and gradually up-titrated to the maximum tolerated dose. Encouraging appropriate and aggressive treatment for both HF and COPD should be recommended to improve quality of life and mortality in HF patients with COPD.",2017,respiratory
38476123,"The Changing and Predicted Trends in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Burden in China, the United States, and India from 1990 to 2030.","This study analyzed the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in China, the United States, and India from 1990 to 2019 and projected the trends for the next decade. This study utilized the GBD 2019 to compare the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate, and the proportion attributed to different risk factors in China, the United States, and India. Joinpoint models and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were employed to capture the changing trends in disease burden and forecast outcomes. From 1990 to 2019, China's age-standardized COPD incidence and mortality rates decreased by 29% and 70%, respectively. In the same period, India's rates decreased by 8% and 33%, while the United States saw an increase of 9% in COPD incidence and a 22% rise in mortality rates. Smoking and ambient particulate matter pollution are the two most significant risk factors for COPD, while household air pollution from solid fuels and low temperatures are the least impactful factors in the United States and India, respectively. The proportion of risk from household air pollution from solid fuels is higher in India than in China and the United States. Predictions for 2030 suggest that the age-standardized DALY rates, ASIR, and ASMR in the United States and India are expected to remain stable or decrease, while China's age-standardized incidence rate is projected to rise. Over the past three decades, the incidence of COPD has been decreasing in China and India, while showing a slight increase in the United States. Smoking and ambient particulate matter pollution are the primary risk factors for men and women, respectively. The risk of household air pollution from solid fuels in India needs attention.",2024,respiratory
24517735,Smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Chinese population: a meta-analysis.,"In recent years, some epidemiological surveys of risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been done in some regions of China, but the relevance is shown different in these surveys. A meta-analysis was undertaken to assess the relationship between smoking and COPD in Chinese population. Twenty-four papers were included in our study. Total number of ever smokers and never smokers were 34,191 and 58,854, the number of COPD cases in each group were 5843 and 4874, respectively. We used meta-analysis method to analyze the selected papers quantitatively, and stratified by type of study, gender and smoking index. Risk of COPD for ever smokers is higher than never smokers [odds ratio (OR) 2.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.22 ∼ 3.80]; after stratifying by gender and smoking index, risks of COPD for male and female ever smokers are higher than male and female never smokers (OR 1.93, 95%CI 1.35 ∼ 2.77; OR 2.67, 95%CI 2.01 ∼ 3.56, respectively); risks of COPD for ever smokers who belong to different smoking index group (1 ∼ 200, 200 ∼ 400, >400, <300, ≥300 cigarettes per day*year) are all higher than never smokers (OR 2.49, 95%CI 1.66 ∼ 3.74; OR 2.91, 95%CI 2.19 ∼ 3.87; OR 4.07, 95%CI 3.17 ∼ 5.23; OR 2.39, 95%CI 1.42 ∼ 4.02; OR 3.31, 95%CI 2.99 ∼ 3.66, respectively).

37853348,Clinical impacts of sarcopenic obesity on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a cross-sectional study.,"Sarcopenia and obesity are two abnormal body composition phenotypes, and sarcopenic obesity (SO) is characterized by both low skeletal muscle mass (sarcopenia) and high adiposity (obesity). SO negatively influences the clinical status of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the studies exploring the prevalence and clinical effects of SO in COPD patients are limited. Our study aimed to elucidate the prevalence and impact of SO on COPD patients. In this cross-sectional study, the pulmonary function, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, exercise tolerance, body composition, and serum levels of resistin and TNF-α were assessed in 198 COPD patients. The clinical value of serum resistin and TNF-α for predicting SO in patients with COPD was evaluated. In the 198 patients with COPD, the prevalence rates of sarcopenia, obesity, and SO in COPD patients were 27.27%, 29.8%, and 9.6%, respectively. Patients with SO experienced more severe symptoms of dyspnea and worse health related quality of life. The expression of resistin increased in patients with SO compared to other patients. The AUC value of serum resistin level for predicting SO was 0.870 (95% CI: 0.799-0.940). BMI (OR: 1.474, 95% CI: 1.124-1.934) and resistin (OR: 1.001, 95% CI: 1.000-1.002) levels were independent risk factors of SO in patients with COPD in Multivariate analysis. The prevalence rates of SO in COPD patients was 9.6%. COPD accompanied by SO is significantly associated with worse pulmonary function and poor physical performance. Serum resistin may be a potential adjunct for predicting SO in COPD patients.",2023,respiratory
37872531,The association between diet quality and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a case-control study.,"Previous investigations have primarily examined the relationship between various dietary patterns and the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, there have been limited studies that have evaluated the association between diet quality presented by Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010) and COPD. The aim of this study was to investigate this association in Iranian population. This case-control study recruited 84 cases and 252 healthy controls who were randomly selected. Diet, smoking, and physical activity were assessed using validated questionnaires. The HEI-2010 score ranged from zero to hundred twenty, with zero indicating an unhealthy diet and hundred twenty indicating a healthy diet. Logistic regression models were utilized to analyze the association between HEI-2010 and the odds of COPD. Results from logistic regression showed that individuals with higher HEI scores had a significantly lower odds of COPD (OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.16-0.72). After adjusting for confounders, individuals with the highest HEI score were 82% less likely to have COPD (OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.03-0.96). This association remained significant after adjusting for smoking and physical activity (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01-0.93) and with additional adjustment for BMI (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01-0.92). This study found a significant association between a higher HEI-2010 score and a lower odd of COPD in the Iranian population. These results suggest that a healthy diet may play a crucial role in reducing the odds of COPD and in improving the function of the lungs. However, further prospective studies are warranted to elucidate this relationship.",2023,respiratory

Specific country data from low-income countries such as Nepal are limited. This review assessed primary evidence on chronic respiratory disease burden among adults in Nepal. A systematic search was performed in June 2019 (updated May 2020) for studies through nine databases. High levels of heterogeneity deemed a narrative synthesis appropriate. Among 27 eligible studies identified, most were low-moderate quality with cross-sectional and retrospective study design. Chronic lung diseases identified were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis and restrictive lung diseases. Studies were categorised as: (i) community-based, (ii) hospital-based and (iii) comorbidity-related and disease burden. Reported disease prevalence varied widely (COPD, 1.67-14.3%; asthma, 4.2-8.9%). The prevalence of airflow obstruction was higher among rural dwellers (15.8%) and those exposed to household air pollution from domestic biomass burning as opposed to liquid petroleum gas users (Odds Ratio: 2.06). Several comorbidities, including hypertension and diabetes mellitus added to the disease burden. The review shows limited literature on lung disease burden in Nepal.

30561365,Early Life Origins of Asthma: A Review of Potential Effectors.,"There is growing evidence that events occurring early in life, both before and after birth, are significantly associated with the risk of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diminished lung function later in life. In fact, from conception to death, a series of continuous, dynamic gene-environment interactions determine 2 fundamental biological processes, namely, lung development and lung aging. Over 130 birth cohorts have been initiated in the last 30 years. Data from these cohorts have improved our understanding of the inception, progression, and persistency of asthma. In this review, we summarize the main data for the early life events proven to determine later development and persistence of asthma, such as maternal atopy and smoking, preterm birth/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, infections, nutrition, obesity, smoking, and other environmental exposures in childhood and adolescence. While some of these factors are obviously impossible to prevent or eliminate, others have been proven to have a protective role, and current research is aimed optimizing them. Available prophylactic measures are also reviewed. In the case of environmental pollution, large scale political interventions successfully managed to decrease contamination levels, leading to improved lung function and lower asthma prevalence in the respective geographical areas. Future research should focus on better understanding these complex interactions in order to develop and enhance effective preventive therapeutic measures.",2019,respiratory
39667326,METTL16 controls airway inflammations in smoking-induced COPD via regulating glutamine metabolism.,"The persistent airway inflammation is the main characteristic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), typically caused by an indoor environment pollution cigarette smoke (CS). METTL16 is an m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase that has been proven to be closely associated with the occurrence of various diseases. However, its exact role in smoking-induced COPD remains to be investigated. In this study, we found that the level of METTL16 was aberrantly decreased in lung tissues of COPD smokers. Similarly, murine model induced by CS and lung epithelial cell model induced by cigarette smoke extract (CSE) also confirmed this discovery. Moreover, in the Mettl16-deficient (Mettl16<sup>+/-</sup>) mice challenged with CS, airway inflammation was aggravated. To identify the potential target genes and regulatory pathways through METTL16, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (meRIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and metabolomic profiling were used. Knockdown of METTL16 significantly reduced the stability of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2) and downregulated its expression through m<sup>6</sup>A modification, while reprogramed glutamine metabolism in lung epithelial cells. Significant reduction in inflammation levels was observed in the 3-month COPD murine model fed a glutamine-supplemented diet. Mechanistically, METTL16 could regulate lung epithelial mitochondrial function by participating in the reprogramming of glutamine metabolism. Our study characterized the role of the METTL16/GOT2/glutamine axis in the occurrence and development of COPD, and emphasized the potential value of METTL16 and glutamine in the therapy of chronic airway inflammation in smoking-induced COPD.",2025,respiratory
28740378,Active smoking and COPD phenotype: distribution and impact on prognostic factors.,"Smoking can affect both the phenotypic expression of COPD and factors such as disease severity, quality of life, and comorbidities. Our objective was to evaluate if the impact of active smoking on these factors varies according to the disease phenotype. This was a Spanish, observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study of patients with a diagnosis of COPD. Smoking rates were described among four different phenotypes (non-exacerbators, asthma-COPD overlap syndrome [ACOS], exacerbators with emphysema, and exacerbators with chronic bronchitis), and correlated with disease severity (body mass index, obstruction, dyspnea and exacerbations [BODEx] index and dyspnea grade), quality of life according to the COPD assessment test (CAT), and presence of comorbidities, according to phenotypic expression. In total, 1,610 patients were recruited, of whom 46.70% were classified as non-exacerbators, 14.53% as ACOS, 16.37% as exacerbators with emphysema, and 22.40% as exacerbators with chronic bronchitis. Smokers were predominant in the latter 2 groups (58.91% and 57.67%, respectively, <i>P</i>=0.03). Active smoking was significantly associated with better quality of life and a higher dyspnea grade, although differences were observed depending on clinical phenotype.

33106845,Genome-Wide Gene-by-Smoking Interaction Study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"Risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is determined by both cigarette smoking and genetic susceptibility, but little is known about gene-by-smoking interactions. We performed a genome-wide association analysis of 179,689 controls and 21,077 COPD cases from UK Biobank subjects of European ancestry recruited from 2006 to 2010, considering genetic main effects and gene-by-smoking interaction effects simultaneously (2-degrees-of-freedom (df) test) as well as interaction effects alone (1-df interaction test). We sought to replicate significant results in COPDGene (United States, 2008-2010) and SpiroMeta Consortium (multiple countries, 1947-2015) data. We considered 2 smoking variables: 1) ever/never and 2) current/noncurrent. In the 1-df test, we identified 1 genome-wide significant locus on 15q25.1 (cholinergic receptor nicotinic β4 subunit, or CHRNB4) for ever- and current smoking and identified PI*Z allele (rs28929474) of serpin family A member 1 (SERPINA1) for ever-smoking and 3q26.2 (MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus, or MECOM) for current smoking in an analysis of previously reported COPD loci. In the 2-df test, most of the significant signals were also significant for genetic marginal effects, aside from 16q22.1 (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3, or SMPD3) and 19q13.2 (Egl-9 family hypoxia inducible factor 2, or EGLN2). The significant effects at 15q25.1 and 19q13.2 loci, both previously described in prior genome-wide association studies of COPD or smoking, were replicated in COPDGene and SpiroMeta.

37559043,The effectiveness of theory-based smoking cessation interventions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a meta-analysis.,"Smoking cessation can effectively reduce the risk of death, alleviate respiratory symptoms, and decrease the frequency of acute exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Effective smoking cessation strategies are crucial for the prevention and treatment of COPD. Currently, clinical interventions based on theoretical frameworks are being increasingly used to help patients quit smoking and have shown promising results. However, theory-guided smoking cessation interventions have not been systematically evaluated or meta-analyzed for their effectiveness in COPD patients. To improve smoking cessation rates, this study sought to examine the effects of theory-based smoking cessation interventions on COPD patients. We adhered to the PRISMA guidelines for our systematic review and meta-analysis. The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Wanfang, CNKI, VIP Information Services Platform, and China Biomedical Literature Service System were searched from the establishment of the database to April 20, 2023. The study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk assessment tool for bias. The revman5.4 software was used for meta-analysis. The I<sup>2</sup> test was used for the heterogeneity test, the random effect model and fixed effect model were used for meta-analysis, and sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding individual studies. A total of 11 RCTs involving 3,830 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Results showed that theory-based smoking cessation interventions improved smoking cessation rates, quality of life, and lung function in COPD patients compared to conventional nursing. However, these interventions did not significantly affect the level of nicotine dependence in patients. Theory-based smoking cessation intervention as a non-pharmacologically assisted smoking cessation strategy has a positive impact on motivating COPD patients to quit smoking and improving their lung function and quality of life.

Genome-wide association studies have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with COPD and the co-occurring conditions, suggesting common biological mechanisms underlying COPD and these co-occurring conditions. To identify them, we have integrated information across different biological levels (i.e., genetic variants, lung-specific 3D genome structure, gene expression and protein-protein interactions) to build lung-specific gene regulatory and protein-protein interaction networks. We have queried these networks using disease-associated SNPs for COPD, unipolar depression and coronary artery disease. COPD-associated SNPs can control genes involved in the regulation of lung or pulmonary function, asthma, brain region volumes, cortical surface area, depressed affect, neuroticism, Parkinson's disease, white matter microstructure and smoking behaviour. We describe the regulatory connections, genes and biochemical pathways that underlay these co-occurring trait-SNP-gene associations. Collectively, our findings provide new avenues for the investigation of the underlying biology and diverse clinical presentations of COPD. In so doing, we identify a collection of genetic variants and genes that may aid COPD patient stratification and treatment.",2023,respiratory

28435242,"Burden of asthma, dyspnea, and chronic cough in South Asia.","Asthma, dyspnea, and chronic cough are well-established risk factors of COPD and often associated with exacerbation of the disease, which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in South Asian countries. The aims of this study were to, 1) measure the prevalence of asthma, dyspnea, and chronic cough, and 2) assess the relationship between these respiratory problems and self-reported health status among South Asians. Data for this research came from the World Health Survey (2002-2003) conducted by the World Health Organization. Subjects were 35,929 men and women, aged 18 years and older, selected from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Crude prevalence rates of asthma, dyspnea, and chronic cough were presented as percentages, and the results of their association with subjective health status were presented as odds ratios and corresponding 95% CIs. Prevalence of daily smoking was highest in Bangladesh (39.9%) and lowest in Sri Lanka (14.1%). Prevalence of asthma was highest in India (6.3%), while Nepal had the highest prevalence of dyspnea (11.3%) and chronic cough (15.3%). Overall prevalence of asthma and dyspnea was higher among women, while that of chronic cough was higher among men. Significant differences were observed in the prevalence rates of all the conditions among regular, occasional, and nonsmokers. A majority of the men and women who had asthma, dyspnea, and chronic cough had higher likelihood of reporting poor health status compared to those who did not have these diseases. Findings suggest that prevalence rates of asthma, dyspnea, and chronic cough were considerably high in all the countries and were significantly associated with poor subjective health. Being a high COPD-prone region, programs targeted to address these diseases could help reduce the burden of COPD and respiratory disease-related mortalities in South Asia.",2017,respiratory
35409931,COPD in Smoking and Non-Smoking Community Members Exposed to the World Trade Center Dust and Fumes.,"Background: The characteristics of community members exposed to World Trade Center (WTC) dust and fumes with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) can provide insight into mechanisms of airflow obstruction in response to an environmental insult, with potential implications for interventions. Methods: We performed a baseline assessment of respiratory symptoms, spirometry, small airway lung function measures using respiratory impulse oscillometry (IOS), and blood biomarkers. COPD was defined by the 2019 GOLD criteria for COPD. Patients in the WTC Environmental Health Center with <5 or ≥5 pack year smoking history were classified as nonsmoker-COPD (ns-COPD) or smoker-COPD (sm-COPD), respectively. Main Results: Between August 2005 and March 2018, 467 of the 3430 evaluated patients (13.6%) fit criteria for COPD. Among patients with COPD, 248 (53.1%) were ns-COPD. Patients with ns-COPD had measures of large airway function (FEV1) and small airway measures (R5−20, AX) that were less abnormal than those with sm-COPD. More ns-COPD compared to sm-COPD had a bronchodilator (BD) response measured by spirometry (24 vs. 14%, p = 0.008) or by IOS (36 vs. 21%, p = 0.002). Blood eosinophils did not differ between ns-COPD and sm-COPD, but blood neutrophils were higher in sm-COPD compared to ns-COPD (p < 0.001). Those with sm-COPD were more likely to be WTC local residents than ns-COPD (p = 0.007). Conclusions: Spirometry findings and small airway measures, as well as inflammatory markers, differed between patients with ns-COPD and sm-COPD. These findings suggest potential for differing mechanisms of airway injury in patients with WTC environmental exposures and have potential therapeutic implications.",2022,respiratory
32050955,Phenotypic comparison between smoking and non-smoking chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Although COPD among non-smokers (NS-COPD) is common, little is known about this phenotype. We compared NS-COPD subjects with smoking COPD (S-COPD) patients in a rural Indian population using a variety of clinical, physiological, radiological, sputum cellular and blood biomarkers. Two hundred ninety subjects (118 healthy, 79 S-COPD, 93 NS-COPD) performed pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry and were followed for 2 years to study the annual rate of decline in lung function. Body plethysmography, impulse oscillometry, inspiratory-expiratory HRCT, induced sputum cellular profile and blood biomarkers were compared between 49 healthy, 45 S-COPD and 55 NS-COPD subjects using standardized methods. Spirometric response to oral corticosteroids was measured in 30 female NS-COPD patients. Compared to all male S-COPD subjects, 47% of NS-COPD subjects were female, were younger by 3.2 years, had greater body mass index, a slower rate of decline in lung function (80 vs 130 mL/year), more small airways obstruction measured by impulse oscillometry (p < 0.001), significantly less emphysema (29% vs 11%) on CT scans, lower values in lung diffusion parameters, significantly less neutrophils in induced sputum (p < 0.05) and tended to have more sputum eosinophils. Hemoglobin and red cell volume were higher and serum insulin lower in S-COPD compared to NS-COPD. Spirometric indices, symptoms and quality of life were similar between S-COPD and NS-COPD. There was no improvement in spirometry in NS-COPD patients after 2 weeks of an oral corticosteroid. Compared to S-COPD, NS-COPD is seen in younger subjects with equal male-female predominance, is predominantly a small-airway disease phenotype with less emphysema, preserved lung diffusion and a slower rate of decline in lung function.",2020,respiratory
33038390,Gaps in COPD Guidelines of Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Scoping Review.,"Guidelines are critical for facilitating cost-effective COPD care. Development and implementation in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is challenging. To guide future strategy, an overview of current global COPD guidelines is required. We systematically reviewed national COPD guidelines, focusing on worldwide availability and identification of potential development, content, context, and quality gaps that may hamper effective implementation. Scoping review of national COPD management guidelines. We assessed: (1) global guideline coverage; (2) guideline information (authors, target audience, dissemination plans); (3) content (prevention, diagnosis, treatments); (4) ethical, legal, and socio-economic aspects; and (5) compliance with the eight Institute of Medicine (IOM) guideline standards. LMICs guidelines were compared with those from high-income countries (HICs). Of the 61 national COPD guidelines identified, 30 were from LMICs. Guidelines did not cover 1.93 billion (30.2%) people living in LMICs, whereas only 0.02 billion (1.9%) in HICs were without national guidelines. Compared with HICs, LMIC guidelines targeted fewer health-care professional groups and less often addressed case finding and co-morbidities. More than 90% of all guidelines included smoking cessation advice. Air pollution reduction strategies were less frequently mentioned in both LMICs (47%) and HICs (42%). LMIC guidelines fulfilled on average 3.37 (42%) of IOM standards, compared with 5.29 (66%) in HICs (P < .05). LMICs scored significantly lower compared with HICs regarding conflicts of interest management, updates, articulation of recommendations, and funding transparency (all, P < .05). Several development, content, context, and quality gaps exist in COPD guidelines from LMICs that may hamper effective implementation. Overall, COPD guidelines in LMICs should be more widely available and should be transparently developed and updated. Guidelines may be further enhanced by better inclusion of local risk factors, case findings, and co-morbidity management, preferably tailored to available financial and staff resources.",2021,respiratory
38386387,Mediating Effect of Tobacco Dependence on the Association Between Maternal Smoking During Pregnancy and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Case-Control Study.,"Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) is a known risk factor for offspring developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to explore whether the increased COPD risk associated with MSDP could be attributed to tobacco dependence (TD). This case-control study used data from the nationwide cross-sectional China Pulmonary Health study, with controls matched for age, sex, and smoking status. TD was defined as smoking within 30 minutes of waking, and the severity of TD was assessed using the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence. COPD was diagnosed when the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity was <0.7 in a postbronchodilator pulmonary function test according to the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria. Logistic regression was used to examine the correlation between MSDP and COPD, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, educational attainment, place of residence, ethnic background, occupation, childhood passive smoking, residential fine particulate matter, history of childhood pneumonia or bronchitis, average annual household income, and medical history (coronary heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes). Mediation analysis examined TD as a potential mediator in the link between MSDP and COPD risk. The significance of the indirect effect was assessed through 1000 iterations of the ""bootstrap"" method. The study included 5943 participants (2991 with COPD and 2952 controls). Mothers of the COPD group had higher pregnancy smoking rates (COPD: n=305, 10.20%; controls: n=211, 7.10%; P<.001). TD was more prevalent in the COPD group (COPD: n=582, 40.40%; controls: n=478, 33.90%; P<.001). After adjusting for covariates, MSDP had a significant effect on COPD (β=.097; P<.001). There was an association between MSDP and TD (β=.074; P<.001) as well as between TD and COPD (β=.048; P=.007). Mediation analysis of TD in the MSDP-COPD association showed significant direct and indirect effects (direct: β=.094; P<.001 and indirect: β=.004; P=.03). The indirect effect remains present in the smoking population (direct: β=.120; P<.001 and indirect: β=.002; P=.03). This study highlighted the potential association between MSDP and the risk of COPD in offspring, revealing the mediating role of TD in this association. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact of prenatal tobacco exposure on lung health, laying the groundwork for the development of relevant prevention and treatment strategies.",2024,respiratory
36771471,Healthful and Unhealthful Plant-Based Diets and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in U.S. Adults: Prospective Study.,"Despite the potential protective effect of a plant-based diet against chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), it remains unknown whether intake of different types of plant foods is beneficial for COPD. Our aims were to determine whether adherence to the healthful version of a plant-based diet (healthful Plant-based Diet Index (hPDI)) is associated with a lower COPD risk, whereas adherence to the unhealthful version (unhealthful Plant-based Diet Index (uPDI)) is associated with a higher COPD risk. 46,948 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, 73,592 women from the Nurses' Health Study, and 85,515 women from the Nurses' Health Study II who completed biennial questionnaires from 1984-2018. We derived diet scores from repeated validated food frequency questionnaires. Among 5,661,994 person-years of follow-up, we documented 2605 validated COPD cases between 1984-2018. After tight control for smoking and other potential confounders, COPD risk was 46% lower among participants with the highest hPDI score compared to those with the lowest score. Conversely, COPD risk was 39% higher among participants with the highest uPDI. Further adjustment for processed meat intake led to similar results. These findings provide further evidence for consuming a diet that emphasizes healthful plant foods to optimize lung health.",2023,respiratory
26263031,Prevalence and Determinants of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Bangladesh.,"There is a paucity of population-based data on COPD prevalence and its determinants in Bangladesh. To measure COPD prevalence and socioeconomic and lifestyle determinants among ≥40 years Bangladeshi adults. In a cross-sectional study, we measured lung function of 3744 randomly selected adults ≥40 years from rural and urban areas in Bangladesh, using a handheld spirometer. COPD was defined according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria as post-bronchodilator ratio of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1st second (FEV1) to Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) < 0.7. In addition, COPD was also assessed by the lower limit of normal (LLN) threshold defined as lower fifth percentile for the predicted FEV1/FVC. The prevalence of COPD was 13.5% by GOLD criteria and 10.3% by LLN criteria. Prevalence of COPD was higher among rural than urban residents and in males than females. More than half of the COPD cases were stage II COPD by both criteria. Milder cases (Stages I and II) were over estimated by the GOLD fixed criteria, but more severe cases (Stages III and IV) were similarly classified. In multiple logistic regression analysis, older age, male sex, illiteracy, underweight, history of smoking (both current and former), history of asthma and solid fuel use were significant predictors of COPD. COPD is a highly prevalent and grossly underdiagnosed public health problem in Bangladeshi adults aged 40 years or older. Illiteracy, smoking and biomass fuel burning are modifiable determinants of COPD.",2015,respiratory
34494959,"Association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, and interstitial lung disease onset in rheumatoid arthritis.","In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), respiratory manifestations include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). We assessed whether baseline COPD and smoking were associated with RA-ILD onset. We identified new-onset ILD in incident RA subjects within the MarketScan Commercial Claims database, using physician and/or hospitalisation diagnostic codes. Smoking data (current, past, never) were available for a subset via a health questionnaire. Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed time to ILD onset, stratified by prior COPD and smoking. Multivariate Cox regression models were adjusted for age, sex, and (in the subset) smoking. Sensitivity analyses adjusted for past RA drugs. Among 373,940 new RA subjects, 6343 (1.7%) developed ILD (8.1 events per 1000 person-year, 95% CI 7.9, 8.3). ILD was more common among subjects with baseline COPD. Adjusting for age and sex, the hazard ratio (HR) between baseline COPD and incident ILD was 2.15, 95% CI 1.93, 2.39. We could not establish a clear relationship between current smoking and ILD; in the subset with smoking data, the HR point estimate for COPD was similar but the 95% CI was wider (due to fewer subjects) and included the null value. Adjusting for baseline RA drugs did not change results. Pre-existing COPD in incident RA subjects was associated with higher risk of future ILD. While a trend persisted after adjusting for smoking, we were limited by reduced sample size. Our study highlights the importance of ongoing assessments of potentially complicated relationships between smoking, COPD, and other factors in RA-associated ILD.",2022,respiratory

40113900,RNA m7G methylation regulators and targets significantly contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common lung injury diseases, closely associated with aging, air pollution and smoking exposure. The novel epigenetic modification 7-methylguanosine (m7G) RNA methylation affects the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. In this study, the combined roles of m7G methylation regulators were explored in COPD for the first time by integrated bioinformatic methods. The machine algorithms screened 7 disease signature genes relevant to clinical indicators, including CYFIP2, EIF3D, EIF4G3, GEMIN5, METTL1, SNUPN and NCBP2, and METTL1 was related to the progression in COPD. COPD patients could be well divided into two m7G subtypes by consensus clustering, and the two groups had differential immune profiles, visualized by single-cell sequencing and immune infiltration landscapes. More importantly, CAT was found to be a meaningful key target gene in METTL1-CAT axis for m7G methylation in COPD. We also used the cell premature senescence model for the preliminary validation of the above biosignature analysis results. The qRT-PCR and GSEA results revealed the important regulatory roles of the seven disease signature genes in COPD and aging-related diseases. Taken together, METTL1 and its target CAT have played an important role in COPD, as excellent candidates for its prevention and intervention.",2025,respiratory
38097585,Prediction and stratification of longitudinal risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease across smoking behaviors.,"Smoking is the leading risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) worldwide, yet many people who never smoke develop COPD. We perform a longitudinal analysis of COPD in the UK Biobank to derive and validate the Socioeconomic and Environmental Risk Score which captures additive and cumulative environmental, behavioral, and socioeconomic exposure risks beyond tobacco smoking. The Socioeconomic and Environmental Risk Score is more predictive of COPD than smoking status and pack-years. Individuals in the highest decile of the risk score have a greater risk for incident COPD compared to the remaining population. Never smokers in the highest decile of exposure risk are more likely to develop COPD than previous and current smokers in the lowest decile. In general, the prediction accuracy of the Social and Environmental Risk Score is lower in non-European populations. While smoking status is often considered in screening COPD, our finding highlights the importance of other non-smoking environmental and socioeconomic variables.",2023,respiratory
36864721,Periodontitis and the incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A longitudinal study of an adult Japanese cohort.,"To examine the relationship between periodontitis as an independent effect of smoking and the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Japanese people based on longitudinal data. We targeted 4745 people who underwent pulmonary function tests and dental check-ups at baseline and 8 years later. The Community Periodontal Index was used to assess periodontal status. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the relationship between the incidence of COPD and periodontitis and smoking. To clarify the interaction between smoking and periodontitis, interaction analysis was performed. In a multivariable analysis, both periodontitis and heavy smoking had significant effects on COPD development. When periodontitis was analysed as a continuous value (number of sextants with periodontitis) and as a category (presence or absence of periodontitis) in the multivariable analyses after adjusting for smoking, pulmonary function and other variables, periodontitis had significantly higher hazard ratios (HRs) for the incidence of COPD; the HRs were 1.09 (1.01-1.17) and 1.48 (1.09-2.02), respectively. Interaction analysis showed no significant interaction between heavy smoking and periodontitis on COPD.

31040338,"Factors associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, based on big data analysis.","Preventing exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is crucial, but requires identification of the exacerbating factors. To date, no integrated analysis of patient-derived and external factors has been reported. To identify factors associated with COPD exacerbation, we collected data, including smoking status, lung function, and COPD assessment test scores, from 594 COPD patients in the Korean COPD subgroup study (KOCOSS), and merged these data with patients' Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service data for 2007-2012. We also collected primary weather variables, including levels of particulate matter <10 microns in diameter, daily minimum ambient temperature, as well as respiratory virus activities, and the logs of web queries on COPD-related issues. We then assessed the associations between these patient-derived and external factors and COPD exacerbations. Univariate analysis showed that patient factors, air pollution, various types of viruses, temperature, and the number of COPD-related web queries were associated with COPD exacerbation. Multivariate analysis revealed that the number of exacerbations in the preceding year, female sex, COPD grade, and influenza virus detection rate, and lowest temperature showed significant association with exacerbation.

37764686,The Possible Role of Food and Diet in the Quality of Life in Patients with COPD-A State-of-the-Art Review.,"Diet has been described as a modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of chronic diseases, and emerging evidence increasingly points to its preventive and therapeutic role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While the relationship between the underlying disease and diet is natural in conditions such as metabolic disorders, obesity, diabetes, etc., the direct effect is not so evident in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Poor diet quality and the development of nutrient deficiencies in respiratory diseases, including COPD, can be associated with disease-specific factors such as the exacerbation of respiratory symptoms. These symptoms can be improved by dietary interventions, leading to positive changes in the pathogenesis of the disease and the quality of life of patients. Therefore, our aim was to review the latest randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of dietary interventions in chronic respiratory patients and describe their effects on respiratory function, physical activity, systemic inflammatory parameters, and quality of life. We conducted a literature search on dietary interventions for COPD patients in the PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases, focusing on publications from 1 July 2018 to 1 July 2023. We used specific keywords and MESH terms, focusing on RCTs. A total of 26 articles and 1811 COPD patients were included in this review. On the basis of our findings, dietary interventions, in particular components of the Mediterranean diet such as protein, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and vegetables, appear to have beneficial effects in patients with chronic respiratory diseases, and their application is beneficial.

This study aimed to examine associations between intakes of 1) total flavonoids, 2) flavonoid subclasses and 3) major flavonoid compounds with incident COPD in participants from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health study. This prospective cohort included 55 413 men and women without COPD, aged 50-65 years at recruitment. Habitual flavonoid intakes at baseline were estimated from a food frequency questionnaire using Phenol-Explorer. Danish nationwide registers were used to identify incident cases of COPD. Associations were modelled using restricted cubic splines within Cox proportional hazards models. During 23 years of follow-up, 5557 participants were diagnosed with COPD. Of these, 4013 were current smokers, 1062 were former smokers and 482 were never-smokers. After multivariable adjustments, participants with the highest total flavonoid intakes had a 20% lower risk of COPD than those with the lowest intakes (quintile 5 <i>versus</i> quintile 1: HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.87); a 6-22% lower risk was observed for each flavonoid subclass. The inverse association between total flavonoid intake and COPD was present in both men and women but only in current smokers (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.70-0.84) and former smokers (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.97), not never-smokers. Furthermore, higher flavonoid intakes appeared to lessen, but not negate, the higher risk of COPD associated with smoking intensity. Dietary flavonoids may be important for partially mitigating the risk of smoking-related COPD. However, smoking cessation should remain the highest priority.",2022,respiratory

Data from 65 patients with ACOS and 65 patients with COPD were retrospectively collected and analyzed. The basis of this study was to compare the two groups while ruling out differences in age, sex and smoking history. Patients with ACOS tended to have earlier ages of onset, longer durations of symptoms, better nutritional status, higher single-breath diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) %predicted and airway resistance %predicted, more exacerbations in the preceding 12 months and shorter lengths of hospitalization. DLCO %predicted, airway resistance %predicted, and length of hospitalization were the variables most significantly associated with the presence of ACOS in patients with COPD. ROC correlating airway resistance %predicted value and current ACOS showed an optimal cutoff of airway resistance %predicted of over 296.6. During follow-up (median: 45 months; interquartile range: 6-82 months), 16 patient deaths were recorded (3 patients with ACOS). The risk remained significantly higher in patients with COPD alone than in patients with ACOS (HR 3.932; 95% CI 1.083-19.755; P  = 0.046).

39104363,Spatial patterns and sociodemographic predictors of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Florida.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic, inflammatory respiratory disease that obstructs airflow and decreases lung function and is a leading cause death globally. In the United States (US), the prevalence among adults is 6.2%, but increases with age to 12.8% among those 65 years or older. Florida has one of the largest populations of older adults in the US, accounting for 4.5 million adults 65 years or older. This makes Florida an ideal geographic location for investigating COPD as disease prevalence increases with age. Understanding the geographic disparities in COPD and potential associations between its disparities and environmental factors as well as population characteristics is useful in guiding intervention strategies. Thus, the objectives of this study are to investigate county-level geographic disparities of COPD prevalence in Florida and identify county-level socio-demographic predictors of COPD prevalence. This ecological study was performed in Florida using data obtained from the US Census Bureau, Florida Health CHARTS, and County Health Rankings and Roadmaps. County-level COPD prevalence for 2019 was age-standardized using the direct method and 2020 US population as the standard population. High-prevalence spatial clusters of COPD were identified using Tango's flexible spatial scan statistics. Predictors of county-level COPD prevalence were investigated using multivariable ordinary least squares model built using backwards elimination approach. Multicollinearity of regression coefficients was assessed using variance inflation factor. Shapiro-Wilks, Breusch Pagan, and robust Lagrange Multiplier tests were used to assess for normality, homoskedasticity, and spatial autocorrelation of model residuals, respectively. County-level age-adjusted COPD prevalence ranged from 4.7% (Miami-Dade) to 16.9% (Baker and Bradford) with a median prevalence of 9.6%. A total of 6 high-prevalence clusters with prevalence ratios >1.2 were identified. The primary cluster, which was also the largest geographic cluster that included 13 counties, stretched from Nassau County in north-central Florida to Charlotte County in south-central Florida. However, cluster 2 had the highest prevalence ratio (1.68) and included 10 counties in north-central Florida. Together, the primary cluster and cluster 2 covered most of the counties in north-central Florida. Significant predictors of county-level COPD prevalence were county-level percentage of residents with asthma and the percentage of current smokers. There is evidence of spatial clusters of COPD prevalence in Florida. These patterns are explained, in part, by differences in distribution of some health behaviors (smoking) and co-morbidities (asthma). This information is important for guiding intervention efforts to address the condition, reduce health disparities, and improve population health.",2024,respiratory
39655060,Unravelling the Information Contained in the Single Items of the COPD Assessment Test for Different Outcomes and Smoking Status in Patients with COPD: Results from COSYCONET.,"The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) comprises eight questions. We evaluated the information that each of the questions and the total score contributed to outcomes and characteristics of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), including their dependence on smoking status. Patients with COPD of the COSYCONET cohort with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades 1-4 and the former grade 0 were included. The evaluated outcomes included mortality, exacerbation risk, the comorbidities asthma, cardiac disease (coronary artery disease/heart failure), osteoporosis, and emphysema, for which a reduction in carbon monoxide transfer coefficient (KCO) <55% predicted was considered as marker. Analyses were performed by Cox proportional hazard or logistic multiple regression analyses separately for smokers and nonsmokers. In total, 2509 patients had complete data, among them 1884 nonsmokers (ex or never; 38.4% female; mean age±SD 66.1±8.5 years) and 625 current smokers (45.1% female, 61.6±7.9 years). The pattern of responses to the single questions of the CAT differed between outcome variables, as well as between smokers and nonsmokers, but in most cases the total score was superior to the single items. The CAT total score was associated with mortality (p<0.05) only in nonsmokers, while for exacerbation frequency/severity, it was of about equal importance in smokers and nonsmokers. Regarding KCO, the total score was indicative (p<0.05) only in nonsmokers. Particularly in smokers, single items could show opposite signs of their coefficients which therefore largely cancelled in the total score. Our results show in detail for which outcomes single items are informative in nonsmokers and current smokers with COPD, overall being more informative in nonsmokers. Only regarding exacerbation risk, the predictive value was similar in both groups. These results might be helpful to extract as much as possible information from a COPD questionnaire that is often part of routine assessment. NCT01245933.",2024,respiratory

36114505,Relationships of serum CC16 levels with smoking status and lung function in COPD.,"The club cell secretory protein (CC16) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and low CC16 serum levels have been associated with both risk and progression of COPD, yet the interaction between smoking and CC16 on lung function outcomes remains unknown. Utilizing cross-sectional data on United States veterans, CC16 serum concentrations were measured by ELISA and log transformed for analyses. Spirometry was conducted and COPD status was defined by post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio < 0.7. Smoking measures were self-reported on questionnaire. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were employed to examine associations between CC16 levels and COPD, and lung function with adjustment for covariates. Unadjusted Pearson correlations described relationships between CC16 level and lung function measures, pack-years smoked, and years since smoking cessation. The study population (N = 351) was mostly male, white, with an average age over 60 years. An interaction between CC16 and smoking status on FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio was demonstrated among subjects with COPD (N = 245, p = 0.01). There was a positive correlation among former smokers and negative correlation among current or never smokers with COPD. Among former smokers with COPD, CC16 levels were also positively correlated with years since smoking cessation, and inversely related with pack-years smoked. Increasing CC16 levels were associated with lower odds of COPD (OR<sub>adj</sub> = 0.36, 95% CI 0.22-0.57, P<sub>adj</sub> < 0.0001). Smoking status is an important effect modifier of CC16 relationships with lung function. Increasing serum CC16 corresponded to increases in FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio in former smokers with COPD versus opposite relationships in current or never smokers. Additional longitudinal studies may be warranted to assess relationship of CC16 with smoking cessation on lung function among subjects with COPD.",2022,respiratory
25586213,"Immunology, genetics and microbiota in the COPD pathophysiology: potential scope for patient stratification.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by sustained inflammation of the airways, leading to destruction of lung tissue and declining pulmonary function. Although smoking is the most obvious risk factor for COPD, only about 20% of smokers develop COPD and smoking cessation does not reverse progression of COPD, indicating that while smoking is an important cause or initiating factor, it is not the only driver of ongoing chronic inflammation and disease progression in COPD patients. We hypothesize that smoking-induced changes in lung microbiota, epithelial integrity and epigenetic control of gene expression result in autoantigen induction and perturbed immune regulation in genetically vunerable individuals. In our view, COPD patients may be stratified according to their immunological and inflammatory status related to specific changes in the lung microbiota (innate and adaptive immunity), presence of autoantigens (adaptive immunity: Th1-B-cell axis) and epigenetic modifications (inflammation and structural changes).",2015,respiratory
35307034,"Asthma and COPD exacerbation in relation to outdoor air pollution in the metropolitan area of Berlin, Germany.","Ambient air pollution poses a major risk for the development and aggravation of respiratory diseases. Evidence suggests that even in low-level air pollution environments there is a risk for an increase in adverse respiratory symptoms. We examined whether variations in daily air pollution levels of nitrogen dioxide, ozone, or particulate matter in Berlin, Germany were associated with hospital admissions of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma patients in a time series analysis. We calculated single and multi-pollutant models, investigated possible lags in effect, and analysed the influence of meteorological variables on the results. Data from January 2005 through December 2015 were used to quantify the concentration-response. The risk ratio for asthma patients to be hospitalised on the same day of NO<sub>2</sub> exposure was 1.101 per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup> NO<sub>2</sub> increase (95% CI: 1.013 to 1.195), for COPD patients 1.123 (95% CI: 1.081 to 1.168). Neither the exposure to ozone (95% CI: 0.904 to 1.020), PM<sub>10</sub> (95% CI: 0.990 to 1.127), nor PM<sub>2.5</sub> (95% CI: 0.981 to 1.148) was associated with an increased risk ratio for asthma patients to be hospitalised. Risk ratios for the hospital admission of COPD patients were also not increased due to ozone (95% CI: 0.981 to 1.033), PM<sub>10</sub> (95% CI: 0.988 to 1.032), or PM<sub>2.5</sub> (95% CI: 0.966 to 1.019) exposure. The presented risk ratios and confidence intervals relate to the day of exposure. We found no increased hospitalisation risks with a delayed occurrence on subsequent days.

33418114,Alkylating and oxidative stresses in smoking and non-smoking patients with COPD: Implications for lung carcinogenesis.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease characterized by chronic inflammation and irreversible airway obstruction. Cigarette smoking is the predominant risk factor for developing COPD. It is well-known that the COPD is also strongly associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Cigarette smoke contains elevated concentrations of oxidants and various carcinogens (e.g., tobacco-derived nitrosamines) that can cause oxidative and alkylating stresses, which can also arise from inflammation. However, it is surprising that, except for oxidative stress, little information is available on the burden of alkylating stress and the detoxification efficiency of tobacco-derived carcinogens in COPD patients. In this study, we used LC-MS/MS to measure the archetypical tobacco-specific carcinogenic 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), its major metabolite, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), three biomarkers of oxidative stress (8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, 8-oxoGua; 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, 8-oxodGuo; 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine, 8-oxoGuo) and two biomarkers of alkylating stress (N7-methylguanine, N7-MeGua and N3-methyladenine, N3-MeAde), in the urine of smoking and non-smoking COPD patients and healthy controls. Our results showed that not only was oxidative stress significantly elevated in the COPD patients compared to the controls, but also alkylating stress. Significantly, levels of alkylating stress (i.e., N7-MeGua) were highly correlated with the COPD severity and not affected by age and smoking status. Furthermore, COPD smokers had significantly higher ratios of free NNAL to the total NNAL than control smokers, implying a lower detoxification efficiency of NNK in COPD smokers. This ratio was even higher in COPD smokers with stages 3-4 than in COPD smokers with stages 1-2. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the detoxification efficiency of tobacco-derived carcinogens (e.g., NNK) was associated with the pathogenesis and possibly the progression of COPD. In addition to oxidative stress, alkylating stress derived from chronic inflammation appears to be also dominant in COPD patients.",2021,respiratory
26301247,Air Pollution by Hydrothermal Volcanism and Human Pulmonary Function.,"The aim of this study was to assess whether chronic exposure to volcanogenic air pollution by hydrothermal soil diffuse degassing is associated with respiratory defects in humans. This study was carried in the archipelago of the Azores, an area with active volcanism located in the Atlantic Ocean where Eurasian, African, and American lithospheric plates meet. A cross-sectional study was performed on a study group of 146 individuals inhabiting an area where volcanic activity is marked by active fumarolic fields and soil degassing (hydrothermal area) and a reference group of 359 individuals inhabiting an area without these secondary manifestations of volcanism (nonhydrothermal area). Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for age, gender, fatigue, asthma, and smoking. The OR for restrictive defects and for exacerbation of obstructive defects (COPD) in the hydrothermal area was 4.4 (95% CI 1.78-10.69) and 3.2 (95% CI 1.82-5.58), respectively. Increased prevalence of restrictions and all COPD severity ranks (mild, moderate, and severe) was observed in the population from the hydrothermal area.

40244222,"Unraveling the Immune Landscape of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Insights into Inflammatory Cell Subtypes, Pathogenesis, and Treatment Strategies.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent respiratory disorder characterized by persistent airway inflammation and progressive airflow limitation, resulting in a significant global health burden and high mortality. This narrative review synthesizes the current evidence on the roles of leukocyte subtypes-including neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils-in the pathogenesis and clinical management of COPD. Relevant original studies and reviews are included, providing data on leukocyte functions, associated biomarkers, and therapeutic implications. Neutrophils contribute to airway damage and remodeling by releasing proteases and reactive oxygen species, particularly in response to environmental exposure such as cigarette smoke or air pollution. Lymphocytes, especially CD8⁺ T cells, drive chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages that promote airway fibrosis and persistent inflammation, further impairing lung function. Eosinophils, though classically linked to asthma, are now recognized for their role in eosinophilic COPD, where they are associated with an increased exacerbation risk and corticosteroid responsiveness. Basophils, though less studied, may influence airway inflammation through interactions with eosinophils and cytokine release. Understanding these immune cell dynamics provides insights into the heterogeneity of COPD and highlights potential targets for precision therapy. Tailored interventions based on inflammatory phenotypes may improve clinical outcomes and advance personalized treatment strategies.",2025,respiratory
34963421,Microbiome Links Cigarette Smoke-Induced Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Dietary Fiber via the Gut-Lung Axis: A Narrative Review.,"Existing comprehensive management strategies for COPD effectively relieve the symptoms of patients, delay the deterioration of lung function, and prevent the progression of COPD through various means and multidisciplinary interventions. However, there has been limited progress in therapies that address the underlying causes of COPD pathogenesis. Recent studies have identified specific changes in the gut and pulmonary microbiota in response to exposure to smoke that can cause or exacerbate CS-COPD by regulating the inflammatory immune response in the lungs through the gut-lung axis. As a convenient and controllable intervention, modifying the diet to include more dietary fiber can effectively improve the prognosis of CS-COPD. Gut microbiota ferment dietary fiber to produce short-chain fatty acids, which connect the microbial communities in the lung and gut mucosa across the gut-lung axis, playing an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive role in the lungs. Given that the effect of dietary fiber on gut microbiota was highly similar to that of quitting smoking on gut microbiota, we assume that microbiota might be a potential therapeutic target for dietary fiber to alleviate and prevent CS-COPD. This study examines the similarities between pulmonary and gut microbiota changes in the presence of smoking and dietary fiber. It also highlights the mechanism by which SCFAs link pulmonary and gut microbiota in CS-COPD and analyzes the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of short-chain fatty acids on CS-COPD <i>via</i> the gut-lung axis.",2021,respiratory

Database searches were conducted using indoor air pollution, biomass and COPD related terms to identify relevant articles. The eligible studies were case-control, retrospective cohort, cross-sectional studies and conducted in adults that assessed COPD using any diagnostic criteria. A total of 35 studies with 73,122 participants were included.

However, combined data on CRS, pulmonary function, lower airway symptoms, and cigarette smoking from the general population are lacking. The current study investigates the relationships between CRS and chronic airflow limitation (CAL), lower airway symptoms and COPD in a middle-aged population of ever-smokers and never-smokers. All subjects from the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) were included. Subjects underwent spirometry after bronchodilation. Chronic airflow limitation was defined as FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio <0.7. Computed tomography imaging of the thorax was performed to detect the presence of emphysema, and the subjects answered a comprehensive questionnaire on CRS, lower airway symptoms, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and cigarette smoking habits. In total, 30,154 adult subjects in the age range of 50-64 years were included. The prevalence of CRS was 5.6%. CRS was more-prevalent among subjects in the following categories: CAL (7.6%), lower airway symptoms (15.7%), current smokers (8.2%), asthma (13.6%), never-smokers and ever-smokers with COPD (17.6% and 15.3%, respectively), emphysema (6.7%), and chronic bronchitis (24.5%). In the adjusted regression model, CRS was significantly associated with CAL (OR 1.40), lower airway symptoms (OR 4.59), chronic bronchitis (OR 6.48), asthma (OR 3.08), and COPD (OR 3.10). In this national, randomly chosen population sample of more than 30,000 middle-aged men and women, CRS is associated with CAL, lower airway symptoms, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and COPD.

30789935,Matrix Metalloproteinases in COPD and atherosclerosis with emphasis on the effects of smoking.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP´s) are known biomarkers of atherosclerosis. MMP´s are also involved in the pathophysiological processes underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cigarette smoking plays an important role in both disease states and is also known to affect the concentration and activity of MMP´s systemically. Unfortunately, the epidemiological data concerning the value of MMP´s as biomarkers of COPD and atherosclerosis with special regards to smoking habits are limited. 450 middle-aged subjects with records of smoking habits and tobacco consumption were examined with comprehensive spirometry, carotid ultrasound examination and biomarker analysis of MMP-1, -3, -7, -10 and -12. Due to missing data 33 subjects were excluded. The remaining 417 participants were divided into 4 different groups. Group I (n = 157, no plaque and no COPD), group II (n = 136, plaque but no COPD), group III (n = 43, COPD but no plaque) and group IV (n = 81, plaque and COPD). Serum levels of MMP-1,-7,-10-12 were significantly influenced by smoking, and MMP-1, -3, -7 and-12 were elevated in subjects with COPD and carotid plaque. This remained statistically significant for MMP-1 and-12 after adjusting for traditional risk factors. COPD and concomitant plaque in the carotid artery were associated with elevated levels of MMP-1 and -MMP-12 even when adjusting for risk factors. Further studies are needed to elucidate if these two MMP´s could be useful as biomarkers in a clinical setting. Smoking was associated with increased serum levels of MMP´s (except for MMP-3) and should be taken into account when interpreting serum MMP results.",2019,respiratory
30461533,Initiating drug therapy in early stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: does it impact the course and outcome?,"Early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is emerging in importance for the clinical and research settings. This review will highlight a proposed definition of early COPD, examine early and midlife factors that lead to development of early COPD and review the literature pertaining to the treatment of mild COPD to gain insight into potential therapeutic approaches for early disease. Early COPD can be defined as disease occurring in patients younger than 50 years in age with a 10-pack-year or more smoking history and abnormal spirometry, imaging or lung function decline. Childhood exposures (maternal smoking and recurrent respiratory infections), childhood and adult asthma, and smoking affect middle-age lung function. Multiple studies of long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) in mild COPD have shown improvements in lung function and symptoms scores. Smoking cessation also has a beneficial effect on longitudinal lung function. Early COPD is an important manifestation of COPD, with a newly proposed definition and associated risk factors identified.

35379844,High miR203a-3p and miR-375 expression in the airways of smokers with and without COPD.,"Smoking is a leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is known to have a significant impact on gene expression and (inflammatory) cell populations in the airways involved in COPD pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the impact of smoking on the expression of miRNAs in healthy and COPD individuals. We aimed to elucidate the overall smoking-induced miRNA changes and those specific to COPD. In addition, we investigated the downstream effects on regulatory gene expression and the correlation to cellular composition. We performed a genome-wide miRNA expression analysis on a dataset of 40 current- and 22 ex-smoking COPD patients and a dataset of 35 current- and 38 non-smoking respiratory healthy controls and validated the results in an independent dataset. miRNA expression was then correlated with mRNA expression in the same patients to assess potential regulatory effects of the miRNAs. Finally, cellular deconvolution analysis was used to relate miRNAs changes to specific cell populations. Current smoking was associated with increased expression of three miRNAs in the COPD patients and 18 miRNAs in the asymptomatic smokers compared to respiratory healthy controls. In comparison, four miRNAs were lower expressed with current smoking in asymptomatic controls. Two of the three smoking-related miRNAs in COPD, miR-203a-3p and miR-375, were also higher expressed with current smoking in COPD patients and the asymptomatic controls. The other smoking-related miRNA in COPD patients, i.e. miR-31-3p, was not present in the respiratory healthy control dataset. miRNA-mRNA correlations demonstrated that miR-203a-3p, miR-375 and also miR-31-3p expression were negatively associated with genes involved in pro-inflammatory pathways and positively associated with genes involved in the xenobiotic pathway. Cellular deconvolution showed that higher levels of miR-203a-3p were associated with higher proportions of proliferating-basal cells and secretory (club and goblet) cells and lower levels of fibroblasts, luminal macrophages, endothelial cells, B-cells, amongst other cell types. MiR-375 expression was associated with lower levels of secretory cells, ionocytes and submucosal cells, but higher levels of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and mast cells, amongst other cell types. In conclusion, we identified two smoking-induced miRNAs (miR-375 and miR-203a-3p) that play a role in regulating inflammation and detoxification pathways, regardless of the presence or absence of COPD. Additionally, in patients with COPD, we identified miR-31-3p as a miRNA induced by smoking. Our identified miRNAs should be studied further to unravel which smoking-induced inflammatory mechanisms are reactive and which are involved in COPD pathogenesis.",2022,respiratory
32450244,Clinical Phenotypes of Atopy and Asthma in COPD: A Meta-analysis of SPIROMICS and COPDGene.,"Little is known about the concordance of atopy with asthma COPD overlap. Among individuals with COPD, a better understanding of the phenotypes characterized by asthma overlap and atopy is needed to better target therapies. What is the overlap between atopy and asthma status among individuals with COPD, and how are categories defined by the presence of atopy and asthma status associated with clinical and radiologic phenotypes and outcomes in the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) and Subpopulation and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS)? Four hundred three individuals with COPD from SPIROMICS and 696 individuals from COPDGene with data about specific IgEs to 10 common allergens and mixes (simultaneous assessment of combination of allergens in similar category) were included. Comparison groups were defined by atopic and asthma status (neither, atopy alone, atopic asthma, nonatopic asthma, with atopy defined as any positive specific IgE (≥0.35 KU/L) to any of the 10 allergens or mixes and asthma defined as self-report of doctor-diagnosed current asthma). Multivariable regression analyses (linear, logistic, and zero inflated negative binomial where appropriate) adjusted for age, sex, race, lung function, smoking status, pack-years smoked, and use of inhaled corticosteroids were used to determine characteristics of groups and relationship with outcomes (exacerbations, clinical outcomes, CT metrics) separately in COPDGene and SPIROMICS, and then adjusted results were combined using meta-analysis. The prevalence of atopy was 35% and 36% in COPD subjects from SPIROMICS and COPDGene, respectively, and less than 50% overlap was seen between atopic status with asthma in both cohorts. In meta-analysis, individuals with nonatopic asthma had the most impaired symptom scores (effect size for St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score, 4.2; 95% CI, 0.4-7.9; effect size for COPD Assessment Test score, 2.8; 95% CI, 0.089-5.4), highest risk for exacerbations (incidence rate ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.05-1.88) compared with the group without atopy or asthma. Those with atopy and atopic asthma were not at increased risk for adverse outcomes. Asthma and atopy had incomplete overlap among former and current smokers with COPD in COPDGene and SPIROMICS.

Participants with ≥10 pack-years of smoking were included. Individuals with self-reported or physician-diagnosed COPD, asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and/or were on inhalers were excluded. Parsimonious multivariable logistic regression models identified factors associated with abnormal spirometry, defined as either airflow obstruction (AFO) or preserved ratio impaired spirometry. Variables were selected for the final model using a stepwise backward variable elimination process which minimized Akaike information criterion (AIC). Similarly, during the 5-year follow-up period, we assessed factors associated with incident diagnosis of COPD. Of 5055 individuals, 1064 (21%) had undiagnosed AFO. Age, pack-years, current smoking and a history of acute bronchitis were associated with AFO while body mass index, female sex, and Black race were inversely associated. Among 2800 participants with 5-year follow-up, 532 (19%) had an incident diagnosis of COPD. Associated risk factors included mMRC ≥2, chronic productive cough, respiratory exacerbations during the follow-up period, and abnormal spirometry. Age was inversely associated. The prevalence of undiagnosed COPD is high in at-risk populations. We found multiple factors associated with undiagnosed COPD and incident diagnosis of COPD at follow up.

Electronic health record data were linked to 1 km modeled particulate matter ≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter exposure estimates. We fit Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, calendar year, smoking, body mass index, comorbidities, medications, and socioeconomic status. In low exposure analyses, we examined effects below the current regulation limit (12 μg/m<sup>3</sup>). <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Among adults with COPD, a 10-μg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in 1-year mean fine particulate matter exposure was associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.20). Effects were stronger in low exposure analyses (hazard ratio, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.56-2.27).

Participants in a COPD disease management group living in an area of low air pollution and who were followed closely for the earliest signs of an exacerbation provided an opportunity to study associations between air pollution and COPD exacerbation. Associations between short term exposures to air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and particulate matter < 2.5 microns (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and COPD exacerbation were assessed among 168 patients residing in central Massachusetts, a region with air pollution levels well below USEPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Case-crossover analyses and multivariate conditional logistic regression were used to estimate associations between 7-day average concentrations of each air pollutant, as measured at central site monitors, and COPD exacerbation experienced in the patients' homes during the period 2012-2013, while controlling for temperature and self-reported influenza. We found that short-term exposures to SO<sub>2</sub> were associated with an increase in COPD exacerbation risk (odds ratio (OR) = 2.45, 95 % CI: 1.75-3.45 per 1 ppb increase) after adjustment for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Short-term exposures to NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations showed a weaker association, (OR = 1.17, 95 % CI: 1.05-1.30 per 1 ppb increase) after adjustment for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. An unexpectedly modest negative association was seen for short-term exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Despite living in an area with air pollution concentrations below current USEPA NAAQS, these COPD patients appeared to suffer increased risk of COPD exacerbation following short-term exposures to increased concentrations of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>. An unexpected negative association with PM<sub>2.5</sub> may result from the complex air chemistry of low level PM in this region.",2016,respiratory
35027824,Effect of Smoking and Its Cessation on the Transcript Profile of Peripheral Monocytes in COPD Patients.,"Smoking is the primary cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, only 10-20% of smokers develop the disease suggesting possible genomic association in the causation of the disease. In the present study, we aimed to explore the whole genome transcriptomics of blood monocytes from COPD smokers (COPD-S), COPD Ex-smokers (COPD-ExS), Control smokers (CS), and Control Never-smokers (CNS) to understand the differential effects of smoking, COPD and that of smoking cessation. Exploratory analyses in form of principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical component analysis (uHCA) were performed to evaluate the similarity in gene expression patterns, while differential expression analyses of different supervised groups of smokers and never smokers were performed to study the differential effect of smoking, COPD and smoking cessation. Differentially expressed genes among groups were subjected to post-hoc enrichment analysis. Candidate genes were subjected to external validation by quantitative RT-PCR experiments. CNS made a cluster completely segregated from the other three subgroups (CS, COPDS and COPD-ExS). About 550, 8 and 5 genes showed differential expression, respectively, between CNS and CS, between CS and COPD-S, and between COPD-S and COPD-ExS. Apoptosis, immune response, cell adhesion, and inflammation were the top process networks identified in enrichment analysis. Two candidate genes (CASP9 and TNFRSF1A) found to be integral to several pathways in enrichment analysis were validated in an external validation experiment. Control never smokers had formed a cluster distinctively separated from all smokers (COPDS, COPD-ExS, and CS), while amongst all smokers, control smokers had aggregated in a separate cluster. Smoking cessation appeared beneficial if started at an early stage as many genes altered due to smoking started reverting towards the baseline, whereas only a few COPD-related genes showed reversal after smoking cessation.",2022,respiratory
28076530,Factors associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease among the elderly.,"This study aimed to identify factors associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) among non-institutionalized elderly people. It involved a cross-sectional study conducted on the basis of a household survey, followed by spirometry. People diagnosed with COPD were compared with those with normal spirometry, through bivariate analysis, followed by multivariate regression analysis. We identified 53 elderly people were identified with COPD. After multivariate analysis, the following factors associated with COPD were identified: past or current smoking (OR: 3.74; 95% CI: 1.65-8.46), presence of chronic sputum (OR: 4.92; 95% CI: 2.03-11.95), pulse oximetry at rest ≤ 90% (OR: 8.74; 95%CI: 1.27-60.07), self-reported asthma (OR: 3.41; 95% CI: 1.01-11.57). The results reveal associated factors that highlight the need to review the selection criteria for patients at risk of COPD among the elderly.",2017,respiratory
33593334,Novel association between asthma and osteoarthritis: a nationwide health and nutrition examination survey.,"Asthma and osteoarthritis (OA) are medical conditions that inhibit physical activity and adversely affect quality of life. Despite the high prevalence, there are limited studies focusing on the comorbid condition and association between asthma and OA. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of OA co-occurring with asthma and to identify the relevant clinical considerations. Adult participants aged over 40 years who completed questionnaire assessments and spirometry tests were enrolled from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Asthma and OA were defined based on the medical history of a diagnosis made by a doctor. Radiographic severities of OA were measured using the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as a comparative respiratory disease, was diagnosed based on the spirometric results. A total of 9344 subjects were enrolled, and the prevalence of asthma and COPD were 4.6% ± 0.3% and 12.0% ± 0.5%, respectively. The prevalence of OA in the asthma group was 31.9% ± 2.8%, which was significantly higher than that in the COPD (17.8% ± 1.5%) or control (16.2% ± 0.6%) groups. OA was more prevalent in patients with asthma after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and smoking status (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.27-2.13). Furthermore, after adjustment of this model for the prescription of OA medication, OA remained independently associated with asthma (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.10-2.20). Conversely, the relationship of OA medication with asthma was not significant (P = 0.64). This relationship was evident in patients with asthma without airflow limitation measured by spirometry (OR 1.97; 95% CI 1.32-2.93). Moreover, the radiographic severity of knee OA correlated with asthma (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.0-‍‍1.21). OA shows a high prevalence in patients with asthma, higher than in patients with COPD or the controls. The comorbid characteristics of these two conditions need to be considered in clinical practice.",2021,respiratory
31127165,Physiological and morphological differences of airways between COPD and asthma-COPD overlap.,"Overlap of asthma and COPD has attracted attention recently. We aimed to clarify physiological and morphological differences of the airways between COPD and asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). Respiratory resistance and reactance and three-dimensional computed tomography data were evaluated in 167 patients with COPD. Among them, 43 patients who fulfilled the diagnosis of asthma were defined as having ACO. Among 124 patients with COPD without ACO, 86 with a comparable smoking history and airflow limitation as those with ACO were selected using propensity score matching (matched COPD). The intraluminal area (Ai) and wall thickness (WT) of third- to sixth-generation bronchi were measured and adjusted by body surface area (BSA; Ai/BSA and WT/√BSA, respectively). Patients with ACO had higher respiratory resistance and reactance during tidal breathing, but a smaller gap between the inspiratory and expiratory phases, compared with matched patients with COPD. Patients with ACO had a greater WT/√BSA in third- to fourth-generation bronchi, smaller Ai/BSA in fifth- to sixth-generation bronchi, and less emphysematous changes than did matched patients with COPD. Even when patients with ACO and those with COPD have a comparable smoking history and fixed airflow limitation, they have different physiological and morphological features of the airways.",2019,respiratory
26392057,Childhood pneumonia increases risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the COPDGene study.,"Development of adult respiratory disease is influenced by events in childhood. The impact of childhood pneumonia on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not well defined. We hypothesize that childhood pneumonia is a risk factor for reduced lung function and COPD in adult smokers. COPD cases and control smokers between 45-80 years old from the United States COPDGene Study were included. Childhood pneumonia was defined by self-report of pneumonia at <16 years. Subjects with lung disease other than COPD or asthma were excluded. Smokers with and without childhood pneumonia were compared on measures of respiratory disease, lung function, and quantitative analysis of chest CT scans. Of 10,192 adult smokers, 854 (8.4%) reported pneumonia in childhood. Childhood pneumonia was associated with COPD (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.17-1.66), chronic bronchitis, increased COPD exacerbations, and lower lung function: post-bronchodilator FEV1 (69.1 vs. 77.1% predicted), FVC (82.7 vs. 87.4% predicted), FEV1/FVC ratio (0.63 vs. 0.67; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Childhood pneumonia was associated with increased airway wall thickness on CT, without significant difference in emphysema. Having both pneumonia and asthma in childhood further increased the risk of developing COPD (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.10-3.18). Children with pneumonia are at increased risk for future smoking-related lung disease including COPD and decreased lung function. This association is supported by airway changes on chest CT scans. Childhood pneumonia may be an important factor in the early origins of COPD, and the combination of pneumonia and asthma in childhood may pose the greatest risk.

36547226,Evaluation of anthropometric methods for fat mass measurement in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. The obesity is a global problem, which is set to increase over time. Chronic obstructive lung disease is the third-leading cause of death globally, and both obesity and diet appear to play roles in its pathophysiology (e.g., role in the development of obstructive sleep apnoea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome). However, the effects of obesity on the respiratory system are often underappreciated. The objective of this study was to compare three anthropometric methods to evaluate of fat mass in COPD patients. Three anthropometric methods of evaluation fat mass in a group of 60 patients with COPD were compared. To the measurement of fat mass were used: (1) Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry method (DEXA), specifically by DEXA densitometer QDR Discovery Wi (S/N 80227) with additional software (Body Composition Analysis); (2) four-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) device Bodystat Quadscan 4000 (Bodystat Ltd, British Isles); (3) skin folds measurement (SFM) with caliper (Harpenden Lange Skinfold Caliper, Cambridge Scientific Industries, Inc. Cambridge, Maryland). The measured values were statistically processed and evaluated in a statistical program Statistica Cz. version 7.1 and Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Los Angeles, CA, USA). Differences among anthropometric methods of measurement fat mass were tested with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). DEXA method, generally accepted for assessing body composition, showed an average value of 22.48 ±11.32 kg of fat mass, which corresponds in percentage terms to the value of 29.62±9.28. BIA method for the parameter fat mass in the monitored group of COPD patients was found the mean value 25.08±10.14 kg (in percentages 30.85±8.15). An average value 28.50±8.08% of fat mass, was determined from the skinfolds measurements (SFM) and subsequent calculations. When comparing these methods (DEXA, BIA and SFM) used to determine body composition, a statistically insignificant difference was found (P >0.05). In this study a good correlation between three anthropometric methods (DEXA, BIA, SFM) for measuring fat mass in patients with COPD and statistically insignificant differences between them were observed. To better define changes in the nutritional status of patients with COPD using anthropometric methods over time, further studies are needed that also monitor the consequences of clinical status, rehabilitation, and nutritional treatment.",2022,respiratory
36172036,Metabolomics Reveals Dysregulated Sphingolipid and Amino Acid Metabolism Associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease presenting as multiple phenotypes, such as declining lung function, emphysema, or persistent airflow limitation caused by several risk factors, including cigarette smoking and air pollution. The inherent complexity of COPD phenotypes propounds difficulties for accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Although metabolomic profiles on COPD have been reported, the role of metabolism in COPD-related phenotypes is yet to be determined. In this study, we investigated the association between plasma sphingolipids and amino acids, and between COPD and COPD-related phenotypes in a Korean cohort. Blood samples were collected from 120 patients with COPD and 80 control participants who underwent spirometry and quantitative computed tomography. The plasma metabolic profiling was carried out using LC-MS/MS analysis. Among the evaluated plasma sphingolipids, an increase in the metabolism of two specific sphingomyelins, SM (d18:1/24:0) and SM (d18:1/24:1) were significantly associated with COPD. There was no significant correlation between any of the SMs and the emphysema index, FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub> in the COPD cohort. Meanwhile, Cer (d18:1/18:0) and Cer (d18:1/24:1) were significantly associated with reduced FEV<sub>1</sub>. Furthermore, the levels of several amino acids were altered in the COPD group compared to that in the non-COPD group; glutamate and alpha AAA were substantial associated with emphysema in COPD. Kynurenine was the only amino acid significantly associated with reduced FEV<sub>1</sub> in COPD. In contrast, there was no correlation between FVC and the elevated metabolites. Our results provide dysregulated plasma metabolites impacting COPD phenotypes, although more studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanism related to COPD pathogenesis.",2022,respiratory
37459011,Chronic respiratory diseases: A rapidly emerging public health menace.,"Chronic respiratory diseases, especially the common chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, are increasing at a swift pace. Although smoking is the most typical risk factor globally, indoor and outdoor air pollution is more important in India. Deaths due to COPD have been next to coronary heart disease since 2014. It causes about 64 deaths per lakh population. It is a chronic and progressive disease having many exacerbations. Mostly senior males are affected. Often, the exacerbation needs intensive care, which may be taxing to the limited intensive care units and may deprive other more warranting patients. The diagnosis requires spirometry, which is available only in private or government tertiary care hospitals. The mainstay of treating both diseases is the inhalation of bronchodilators with or without steroids. The diagnosis and treatment are costly, and treatment is required lifelong. Reduction in risk factors is a challenging and long journey. It requires behavioral change communication. The government in the health sector has critical options. On the one hand, the disease is increasing for various reasons; on the other hand, resources are enormously required for prevention and management. The ASHA system and health and wellness centers, which have not been given due importance, can screen, diagnose, and manage majorly patients. Public health specialists should forcefully advocate for resources required for training and equipment.",2023,respiratory
29745294,Prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: county-level risk factors based on the Social Ecological Model.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was the third leading cause of death among Americans in 2014. Multiple factors, ranging from proximal (i.e. biological characteristics and behaviors) to distal (i.e. environmental characteristics and policies), have been shown to predict COPD outcomes. The Social Ecological Model (SEM), which specifies that five levels of influence (i.e. intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, community, and public policy factors) are implicated in the development of ill health, has not been used in epidemiological studies of COPD prevalence. A better understanding of the community-level correlates of COPD prevalence may improve community health practice. Using several sources of county-level secondary data ( n = 646), changes in COPD prevalence from 2012 to 2014 were predicted from the five levels of the SEM using ordinary least squares (OLS) hierarchical linear regression. The geographic distribution of county-level changes in COPD prevalence was analyzed with a choropleth map. County-level COPD prevalence increased by 4.76% between 2012 and 2014 overall; however, the greatest increases were observed among counties within the Appalachian region (i.e. counties in West Virginia). Results showed that the SEM, with five levels of influence, was a statistically significant framework for examining changes in county-level COPD prevalence, F = 10.21, p < .001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.28. Statistically significant county-level predictors of changes in COPD prevalence included racial composition, ethnic composition, poverty, altitude, air pollution, and smoking policy.

The mean age of both groups was 67 years, and 71.2% and 93.8% were male in the COPD subjects from the KNHANES and the KOLD, respectively. The mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second of predicted value was 79.1% (KNHANES) and 55.4% (KOLD). The frequency of risk factors of cigarette smoking (C), infection (I), pollution (P), and asthma (A) was 54.6%, 9.4%, 10.7%, and 7.9%, respectively, in the KNHANES COPD subjects, and 88.4%, 26.6%, 41.6%, and 35.2%, respectively, in the KOLD COPD subjects. Risk factors were unidentified in 32.6% (KNHANES) and 3.1% (KOLD) of COPD subjects. Additionally, 14.1% and 66.2% of subjects with COPD had two or more risk factors in the KNHANES and KOLD, respectively. The profiles of risk factors C, I, P, and A were identified and appeared to be different among the two COPD groups from a general population or referral clinics.

36414410,Smoking induces shifts in cellular composition and transcriptome within the bronchial mucus barrier.,"Smoking disturbs the bronchial-mucus-barrier. This study assesses the cellular composition and gene expression shifts of the bronchial-mucus-barrier with smoking to understand the mechanism of mucosal damage by cigarette smoke exposure. We explore whether single-cell-RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) based cellular deconvolution (CD) can predict cell-type composition in RNA-seq data. RNA-seq data of bronchial biopsies from three cohorts were analysed using CD. The cohorts included 56 participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] (38 smokers; 18 ex-smokers), 77 participants without COPD (40 never-smokers; 37 smokers) and 16 participants who stopped smoking for 1 year (11 COPD and 5 non-COPD-smokers). Differential gene expression was used to investigate gene expression shifts. The CD-derived goblet cell ratios were validated by correlating with staining-derived goblet cell ratios from the COPD cohort. Statistics were done in the R software (false discovery rate p-value < 0.05). Both CD methods indicate a shift in bronchial-mucus-barrier cell composition towards goblet cells in COPD and non-COPD-smokers compared to ex- and never-smokers. It shows that the effect was reversible within a year of smoking cessation. A reduction of ciliated and basal cells was observed with current smoking, which resolved following smoking cessation. The expression of mucin and sodium channel (ENaC) genes, but not chloride channel genes, were altered in COPD and current smokers compared to never smokers or ex-smokers. The goblet cell-derived staining scores correlate with CD-derived goblet cell ratios. Smoking alters bronchial-mucus-barrier cell composition, transcriptome and increases mucus production. This effect is partly reversible within a year of smoking cessation. CD methodology can predict goblet-cell percentages from RNA-seq.",2023,respiratory
29096609,Asthma-COPD overlap is not a homogeneous disorder: further supporting data.,"Asthma-COPD ovelap (ACO) is an umbrella term that encompasses patients with COPD and eosinophilic inflammation (e-COPD) and smoking asthmatics with non-fully reversible airflow obstruction (SA). We compared the clinical characteristics and the inflammatory profile of e-COPD and SA. Patients classified as e-COPD were older and more often male and showed significantly impaired pulmonary function (likely explained by a heavier smoking habit). On the contrary, SA had more atopic features, more reversibility of airflow obstruction and higher IgE levels. The concentrations of IL-5, IL-13, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, IL17 in serum were similar between the 2 groups. However, Th2-related biomarkers (periostin, FeNO and blood eosinophils) shower higher median values in e-COPD patients.

40155891,Distinct risks of exacerbation and lung function decline between never-smokers and ever-smokers with COPD.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can occur in patients without a history of smoking, which is a strong risk factor for COPD. However, few studies have focused on the prognosis of never-smokers with COPD. We investigated the difference of the longitudinal clinical outcomes between never-smokers and ever-smokers with COPD. We retrospectively analyzed patients with COPD who underwent chest computed tomography and longitudinal lung function tests from January 2013 to December 2020. We classified patients according to smoking status and examined their histories of acute exacerbation and long-term changes in lung function. Among 583 patients with COPD, 75 (12.9%) had no smoking history. These never-smokers with COPD were predominantly women; they had a lower forced vital capacity and a higher prevalence of asthma, history of tuberculosis, tuberculosis-destroyed lung, and bronchiectasis, but a lower prevalence of emphysema, relative to ever-smokers with COPD. Never-smokers with COPD had significantly lower risks of subsequent moderate to severe exacerbation (β ± standard error, - 0.4 ± 0.12; P = 0.001), any exacerbation (adjusted odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.26 - 0.8; P = 0.006), and frequent exacerbation (adjusted odds ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 - 0.89; P = 0.03) than ever-smokers with COPD. Never-smokers with COPD also showed significantly slower annual decline of forced expiratory volume in 1 s than ever-smokers with COPD (- 15.7 ± 4.7 vs. -30.4 ± 2.9 mL, respectively; P = 0.03).

26948980,Associations between obstructive lung disease and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea in a general population.,"To examine the prevalence of self-reported symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in relation to asthma, respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function. A secondary objective was to determine how sex impacted these relationships. A random sample of all adults aged 47-48 and 71-73 years living in Bergen, Norway, were invited. Participants (3506, 69%) underwent spirometry testing and completed a questionnaire on sleep, respiratory symptoms and past medical history. OSA was defined by positive answers to questions on snoring, breathing cessations and daytime sleepiness. Current asthma was defined by ever having received a physician's diagnosis of asthma and current use of anti-asthma medication. Logistic regression analyses, including interaction analyses between sex and the different explanatory variables, were used to examine associations between OSA and current asthma, pre- and post-bronchodilator pulmonary function tests, smoking habits and respiratory symptoms. All models were adjusted for age, sex, waist-hip ratio and smoking. OSA was more prevalent in the middle-aged compared to the elderly (6.2% vs 3.6%), and in subjects reporting respiratory symptoms. 4.8% had OSA and 6.1% had current asthma. Current asthma and the lowest quartile of post-bronchodilator FVC were significantly associated with OSA with ORs of 2.5 (1.5, 4.2) and 1.7 (1.1, 2.7), respectively. In interaction analyses, women with post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> /FVC < 0.7 had an increased risk of OSA [OR of 4.1 (1.7, 9.7)] compared to women with a FEV<sub>1</sub> /FVC ≥ 0.7.

38568439,Air Pollution Exposure and Interstitial Lung Features in SPIROMICS Participants with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"<b>Rationale:</b> It is unknown whether air pollution is associated with radiographic features of interstitial lung disease in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). <b>Objectives:</b> To determine whether air pollution increases the prevalence of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) or percent high-attenuation areas (HAA) on computed tomography (CT) in individuals with a heavy smoking history and COPD. <b>Methods:</b> We performed a cross-sectional study of SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study), focused on current or former smokers with COPD. Ten-year exposure to particulate matter ⩽2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone before enrollment CT (completed between 2010 and 2015) were estimated with validated spatiotemporal models at residential addresses. We applied adjusted multivariable modified Poisson regression and linear regression to investigate associations between pollution exposure and relative risk (RR) of ILA or increased percent HAA (between -600 and -250 Hounsfield units), respectively. We assessed for effect modification by <i>MUC5B</i>-promoter polymorphism (variant allele carriers GT or TT vs. GG at rs3705950), smoking status, sex, and percent emphysema. <b>Results:</b> Among 1,272 participants with COPD assessed for HAA, 424 were current smokers, and 249 were carriers of the variant <i>MUC5B</i> allele. A total of 519 participants were assessed for ILA. We found no association between pollution exposure and ILA or HAA. Associations between pollutant exposures and risk of ILA were modified by the presence of <i>MUC5B</i> polymorphism (<i>P</i> value interaction term for NO<sub>x</sub> = 0.04 and PM<sub>2.5</sub> = 0.05) and smoking status (<i>P</i> value interaction term for NO<sub>x</sub> = 0.05; NO<sub>2</sub> = 0.01; and ozone = 0.05). With higher exposure to NO<sub>x</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, <i>MUC5B</i> variant carriers had an increased risk of ILA (RR per 26 ppb NO<sub>x</sub>, 2.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-6.0; and RR per 4 μg ⋅ m<sup>-3</sup> PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.93-2.2, respectively).

32547002,Innate Immunity and Cell Surface Receptors in the Pathogenesis of COPD: Insights from Mouse Smoking Models.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is mainly associated with smoking habit. Inflammation is the major initiating process whereby neutrophils and monocytes are attracted into the lung microenvironment by external stimuli present in tobacco leaves and in cigarette smoke, which promote chemotaxis, adhesion, phagocytosis, release of superoxide anions and enzyme granule contents. A minority of smokers develops COPD and different molecular factors, which contribute to the onset of the disease, have been put forward. After many years of research, the pathogenesis of COPD is still an object of debate. In vivo models of cigarette smoke-induced COPD may help to unravel cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of COPD. The mouse represents the most favored animal choice with regard to the study of immune mechanisms due to its genetic and physiological similarities to humans, the availability of a large variability of inbred strains, the presence in the species of several genetic disorders analogous to those in man, and finally on the possibility to create models ""made-to-measure"" by genetic manipulation. The review outlines the different response of mouse strains to cigarette smoke used in COPD studies while retaining a strong focus on their relatability to human patients. These studies reveal the importance of innate immunity and cell surface receptors in the pathogenesis of pulmonary injury induced by cigarette smoking. They further advance the way in which we use wild type or genetically manipulated strains to improve our overall understanding of a multifaceted disease such as COPD. The structural and functional features, which have been found in the different strains of mice after chronic exposure to cigarette smoke, can be used in preclinical studies to develop effective new therapeutic agents for the different phenotypes in human COPD.",2020,respiratory
39969938,Effect of Smoking on Mortality in Individuals With COPD in the United States.,"<b>Background:</b> COPD remains a significant public health challenge and a leading cause of mortality in the United States. Whereas the detrimental impact of smoking on COPD progression is well documented, the specific effects of smoking status on mortality risk among adults with COPD require further elucidation. Thus, this study investigates the relationship between smoking status (current smoker, former smoker, non-smoker) and mortality risk among patients diagnosed with COPD. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which was linked to mortality data from the National Death Index (NDI). Survival probabilities were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the associations between smoking status and mortality risk were quantified by using hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs derived from univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. In the multivariate models, we adjusted for sex, age, marital status, heart condition, drinking status, body mass index, and health status. <b>Results:</b> The multivariate model revealed a significantly higher mortality risk for former smokers (HR 1.619, 95% CI 1.198-2.188) and current smokers (HR 1.894, 95% CI 1.386-2.590) compared with non-smokers. Marital status significantly modified the smoking status-mortality relationship in adults with COPD (<i>P</i> = .01), with single/never married former smokers exhibiting the highest mortality risk (HR 3.711, 95% CI 1.130-12.187). <b>Conclusions:</b> Both current and former smoking statuses are associated with an increased mortality risk in adults with COPD.

30464013,High COPD prevalence at high altitude: does household air pollution play a role?,"Studies comparing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) prevalence across altitudes report conflicting results. However, household air pollution (HAP), a major COPD risk factor, was mostly not accounted for in previous analyses and never objectively measured. We aimed to compare the prevalence of COPD and its risk factors between low-resource highlands and lowlands, with a particular focus on objectively measured HAP.We conducted a population-based, observational study in a highland (∼2050 m above sea level) and a lowland (∼750 m above sea level) setting in rural Kyrgyzstan. We performed spirometry in randomly selected households, measured indoor particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 µm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and administered a questionnaire on other COPD risk factors. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regressions were used for analyses.We included 392 participants: 199 highlanders and 193 lowlanders. COPD was more prevalent among highlanders (36.7% <i>versus</i> 10.4%; p<0.001). Their average PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure was also higher (290.0 <i>versus</i> 72.0 µg·m<sup>-3</sup>; p<0.001). In addition to high PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure (OR 3.174, 95% CI 1.061-9.493), the altitude setting (OR 3.406, 95% CI 1.483-7.825), pack-years of smoking (OR 1.037, 95% CI 1.005-1.070) and age (OR 1.058, 95% CI 1.037-1.079) also contributed to a higher COPD prevalence among highlanders.COPD prevalence and HAP were highest in the highlands, and were independently associated. Preventive interventions seem warranted in these low-resource, highland settings. With this study being one of the first spirometry-based prevalence studies in Central Asia, generalisability needs to be assessed.",2019,respiratory
34998380,Respiratory-related death in individuals with incident asthma and COPD: a competing risk analysis.,"Distinguishing between mortality attributed to respiratory causes and other causes among people with asthma, COPD, and asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) is important. This study used electronic health records in England to estimate excess risk of death from respiratory-related causes after accounting for other causes of death. We used linked Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) primary care and Office for National Statistics mortality data to identify adults with asthma and COPD from 2005 to 2015. Causes of death were ascertained using death certificates. Hazard ratios (HR) and excess risk of death were estimated using Fine-Gray competing risk models and adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, body mass index and socioeconomic status. 65,021 people with asthma and 45,649 with COPD in the CPRD dataset were frequency matched 5:1 with people without the disease on age, sex and general practice. Only 14 in 100,000 people with asthma are predicted to experience a respiratory-related death up to 10 years post-diagnosis, whereas in COPD this is 98 in 100,000. Asthma is associated with an 0.01% excess incidence of respiratory related mortality whereas COPD is associated with an 0.07% excess. Among people with asthma-COPD overlap (N = 22,145) we observed an increased risk of respiratory-related death compared to those with asthma alone (HR = 1.30; 95% CI 1.21-1.40) but not COPD alone (HR = 0.89; 95% CI 0.83-0.94). Asthma and COPD are associated with an increased risk of respiratory-related death after accounting for other causes; however, diagnosis of COPD carries a much higher probability. ACO is associated with a lower risk compared to COPD alone but higher risk compared to asthma alone.",2022,respiratory
37394482,Smoking cessation after diagnosis of COPD is associated with lower all-cause and cause-specific mortality: a nationwide population-based cohort study of South Korean men.,"The most effective way to halt the advancement of COPD is smoking cessation. However, limited data are available on the question of whether quitting smoking within two years after COPD diagnosis reduces the risk of mortality. The goal of our research was to analyze the relationship between quitting smoking after COPD diagnosis and the risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality, using the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database. This study included 1,740 male COPD patients aged 40 years or more who had been newly diagnosed within the 2003-2014 time period and had smoked prior to their COPD diagnosis. The patients were categorized into two groups according to their smoking status after COPD diagnosis: (i) persistent smokers (ii) quitters (smoking cessation within two years of COPD diagnosis). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to determine the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for both all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Among 1,740 patients (mean age, 64.6 years; mean follow-up duration, 7.6 years), 30.5% stopped smoking after COPD diagnosis. Quitters gained a 17% risk reduction in all-cause mortality (aHR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69-1.00) and a 44% risk reduction in cardiovascular mortality (aHR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.95) compared with persistent smokers. Our study found that patients who quit smoking within two years after COPD diagnosis had lower risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality relative to persistent smokers. These results can be used to encourage newly diagnosed COPD patients to stop smoking.",2023,respiratory
34649155,Unmet need in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the Middle East and Africa region: An expert panel consensus.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has a significant impact on healthcare systems and health-related quality of life. Increased prevalence of smoking is an important factor contributing to high burden of COPD in the Middle East and Africa (MEA). Several other factors including sedentary lifestyle, urbanization, second-hand smoke, air pollution, and occupational exposure are also responsible for the upsurge of COPD in the MEA. Frequent COPD exacerbations accelerate disease progression, progressively deteriorate the lung function, and negatively affect quality of life. This consensus is based on review of the published evidence, international and regional guidelines, and insights provided by the expert committee members from the MEA region. Spirometry, though the gold standard for diagnosis, is often unavailable and/or underutilized leading to underdiagnosis of COPD in primary care settings. Low adherence to the treatment guidelines and delayed use of appropriate combination therapy including triple therapy are additional barriers in management of COPD in MEA. It is necessary to recognize COPD as a screenable condition and develop easy and simple screening tools to facilitate early diagnosis. Knowledge of the disease symptomatology at patient and physician level and adherence to the international or regional guidelines are important to create awareness about harmful effects of smoking and develop national guidelines to focus on prevention on COPD. Implementation of vaccination program and pulmonary rehabilitation are equally valuable to manage patients with COPD at local and regional level. We present recommendations made by the expert panel for improved screening, diagnosis, and management of COPD in MEA.",2021,respiratory

We hypothesized that smoking and early COPD have a joint negative influence on these outcomes. We evaluated 32 smokers (smoking history >10 pack/years), 32 mild/moderate COPD (current smokers or former smokers), and 32 never smokers. All individuals underwent medical and smoking status evaluations, pre and post-bronchodilator spirometry, BC [fat-free mass (FFM) and FFM index (FFMI)], EC [six-minute walk distance (6MWD)] and HS [Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)]. FFM (p = 0.02) and FFMI (p = 0.008) were lower in COPD than never smokers. 6MWT, as a percentage of reference values for the Brazilian population, was lower in COPD and smokers than never smokers (p = 0.01). Smokers showed worse SF-36 score for functional capacity than never smokers (p<0.001). SF-36 score for physical functioning (p<0.001) and role-emotional (p<0.001) were impaired in COPD patients than smokers. SF-36 scores for physical functioning (p<0.001), role-physical (p = 0.01), bodily pain (p = 0.01), vitality (p = 0.04) and role-emotional (p<0.001) were lower in COPD than never smokers. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that both COPD diagnosis and smoking were inversely associated with FFMI, 6MWD and HS.

35620348,Prevalence of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Chronic Bronchitis Among Predominantly Smoking Workers in the Seafood Industry in Greenland.,"For decades, the prevalence of smoking has been high in Greenland. Even so, the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a smoking-related disease, remains largely unexplored. This cross-sectional study aimed to estimate the prevalence of COPD and chronic bronchitis (CB) among Inuit workers in the seafood industry in Greenland. A total of 355 participants, 254 males and 101 females, met the inclusion criteria. Participants had a mean age of 38 years (standard deviation 13.5; range 17-68 years). COPD was diagnosed based on post-bronchodilator ratio between forced expiratory volume within one second and forced vital capacity (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC) below the lower limit of normal (LLN) according to the Global Lung Function Initiative. Participants completed a questionnaire aiming to diagnose CB. The overall prevalence was 9.9% for COPD; 7.4% for CB. Participants were predominantly smokers; 73.2% active smokers, 91.8% active or former smokers. The prevalence of COPD was high, especially among those under 40 years of age. Both COPD and CB were associated with smoking status. This study among Greenlandic seafood workers found that smoking was a risk factor for COPD and CB among Greenlanders of Inuit origin. The high prevalence of COPD and the high prevalence of smoking underlines the importance of further initiatives to reduce smoking in Greenland.",2022,respiratory
39467610,20-year trends in excess costs of COPD.,"Several major risk factors for COPD, such as population ageing, smoking rates and air pollution levels, are rapidly changing, causing inevitable changes in the population burden of COPD. We determined the excess direct costs of COPD and their trend from 2001 to 2020. Using administrative health data from British Columbia, Canada, we created a retrospective matched cohort of physician-diagnosed COPD patients and non-COPD individuals. Excess direct medical costs (in 2020 Canadian dollars (CAD)) were estimated by analysing hospital records, outpatient services, medications and community care services. Comorbidity classes were assessed using International Classification of Diseases codes. Excess COPD costs were estimated as the adjusted difference in direct medical costs between the COPD and non-COPD cohorts. There were 208 554 and 404 703 individuals in the COPD and non-COPD cohorts, respectively (47.8% female; mean baseline age 69.1 and 68.2 years, respectively). Direct medical costs for COPD were CAD 9224 per patient-year compared to CAD 3396 per patient-year for non-COPD, giving rise to excess costs of CAD 5828 (95% CI 5759-5897) per patient-year. Excess costs increased by 48% over the study period. Excess costs due to comorbidities were CAD 3588 (95% CI 3554-3622) per patient-year, with cardiovascular-related conditions alone exceeding the costs attributed to COPD (CAD 1375 <i>versus</i> 904 per patient-year). Despite multifaceted prevention and management initiatives, COPD-related economic burden is increasing, with the majority of costs due to comorbid conditions.

36611860,"Mechanisms of Lung Damage and Development of COPD Due to Household Biomass-Smoke Exposure: Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, MicroRNAs, and Gene Polymorphisms.","Chronic exposure to indoor biomass smoke from the combustion of solid organic fuels is a major cause of disease burden worldwide. Almost 3 billion people use solid fuels such as wood, charcoal, and crop residues for indoor cooking and heating, accounting for approximately 50% of all households and 90% of rural households globally. Biomass smoke contains many hazardous pollutants, resulting in household air pollution (HAP) exposure that often exceeds international standards. Long-term biomass-smoke exposure is associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in adults, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, chronic bronchitis, and other lung conditions. Biomass smoke-associated COPD differs from the best-known cigarette smoke-induced COPD in several aspects, such as a slower decline in lung function, greater airway involvement, and less emphysema, which suggests a different phenotype and pathophysiology. Despite the high burden of biomass-associated COPD, the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are poorly understood. This review describes the pathogenic mechanisms potentially involved in lung damage, the development of COPD associated with wood-derived smoke exposure, and the influence of genetic and epigenetic factors on the development of this disease.",2022,respiratory

However, smokers and ex-smokers have lower F<sub>E</sub>NO values, and the clinical use of F<sub>E</sub>NO values in COPD patients is unclear. Therefore, we investigated if F<sub>E</sub>NO had a relationship to different COPD characteristics in smoking and ex-smoking subjects. Patients with COPD (<i>n</i> = 533, 58% females) were investigated while in stable condition. Measurements of F<sub>E</sub>NO<sub>50</sub>, blood cell counts, IgE sensitisation and lung function were performed. Medication reconciliation was used to establish medication usage. Smokers (<i>n</i> = 150) had lower F<sub>E</sub>NO<sub>50</sub> 9 (8, 10) ppb (geometric mean, 95% confidence interval) than ex-smokers did (<i>n</i> = 383) 15 (14, 16) ppb, <i>p</i> < 0.001. F<sub>E</sub>NO<sub>50</sub> was not associated with blood eosinophil or neutrophil levels in smokers, but in ex-smokers significant associations were found (<i>r</i> = 0.23, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and (<i>r</i> = -0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.001), respectively. Lower F<sub>E</sub>NO values were associated with lower FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted in both smokers (<i>r</i> = 0.17, <i>p</i> = 0.040) and ex-smokers (<i>r</i> = 0.20, <i>p</i> < 0.001).

This was not found in smokers (<i>p</i> = 0.325). F<sub>E</sub>NO is associated with eosinophil inflammation and the use of ICS in ex-smoking COPD subjects, but not in smoking subjects suggesting that the value of F<sub>E</sub>NO as an inflammatory marker is more limited in smoking subjects.

33690706,Prediction of COPD risk accounting for time-varying smoking exposures.,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Studies have primarily assessed the relationship between smoking on COPD risk focusing on summary measures, like smoking status. Develop a COPD risk prediction model incorporating individual time-varying smoking exposures. The Nurses' Health Study (N = 86,711) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (N = 39,817) data was used to develop a COPD risk prediction model. Data was randomly split in 50-50 samples for model building and validation. Cox regression with time-varying covariates was used to assess the association between smoking duration, intensity and year-since-quit and self-reported COPD diagnosis incidence. We evaluated the model calibration as well as discriminatory accuracy via the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC). We computed 6-year risk of COPD incidence given various individual smoking scenarios. Smoking duration, year-since-quit (if former smokers), sex, and interaction of sex and smoking duration are significantly associated with the incidence of diagnosed COPD. The model that incorporated time-varying smoking variables yielded higher AUCs compared to models using only pack-years. The AUCs for the model were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.74-0.86) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.70-0.77) for males and females, respectively. Utilizing detailed smoking pattern information, the model predicts COPD risk with better accuracy than models based on only smoking summary measures.

34595990,"Strategies for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COPD in low- and middle- income countries: the importance of primary care.","Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear a high proportion of the global morbidity and mortality caused by COPD. Increased exposure to risk factors throughout life (e.g. malnutrition, indoor and outdoor air pollution, and smoking) is associated with higher COPD prevalence in LMICs and the lack of treatment availability increases avoidable harm. This review covers the epidemiology and burden of COPD in LMICs, and challenges and recommendations related to health-care systems, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Main challenges are related to under-resourced health-care systems (such as limited availability of spirometry, rehabilitation, and medicines). Lack of policy and practical local guidelines on COPD diagnosis and management further contribute to the low diagnostic and treatment rates. In the absence of, or limited number of respiratory specialists, primary care practitioners (general practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, and community health workers) play an even more pivotal role in COPD management in LMICs. Raising awareness on COPD, educating health-care workers, patients, and communities on cost-effective preventive measures as well as improving availability, affordability and proper use of diagnostic and pharmacological and non-pharmacologic treatment in primary care are the key interventions needed to improve COPD prevention, diagnosis, and care in LMICs.",2021,respiratory

The study included 56 patients with COPD with smoking history and 84 controls. Wrinkle intensity was measured and classified using Daniell's grading system, and the total length of wrinkles was also estimated. The predominant grades of Daniell's scale were IV-V for COPD patients (89.3% of current and 75.0% of former smokers), III-V for controls who currently smoke (89.2%), and II-III for former (92.9%) and never smokers (100%) controls. These distributions were statistically significantly different, but current and former smokers with COPD and COPD former smokers and control current smokers did not differ. In terms of the total length of wrinkles, the COPD patients possessed significantly longer wrinkles than the control subgroups (all <i>p</i>-values were <0.004). Negative correlations between wrinkle length and lung parameters were found. This phenomenon seems to be independent of smoking, but the length of wrinkles is related to lung function parameters.

27240624,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and HIV: are we appropriately screening?,"Individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) represent a population that is at a higher risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, we sought to determine the effects of smoking on respiratory symptoms and diseases among HIV-positive patients and to determine if symptomatic patients are being appropriately screened for COPD. HIV-positive individuals completed a self-administered questionnaire. The effects of smoking on respiratory symptoms and diseases were reported as odds ratios (ORs). The COPD screening criteria were adapted from the Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) guidelines. Two hundred and forty-seven participants were recruited. The median age was 49 years; 75% were male and 92% were on highly active antiretroviral therapy. Smokers represented 66% of the population. Smoking had a statistically significant effect on respiratory symptoms including wheeze (OR 4.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-14.2]), phlegm production (OR 4.9 [95% CI: 2.2-10.5]), cough (OR 7.0 [95% CI: 3.0-16.2]), and dyspnea (OR 7.2 [95% CI: 1.7-31.2]).

39622328,[Clinical Management of Respiratory Diseases in Neurosurgical Settings].,"Respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD)and asthma, are becoming increasingly prevalent in super-aging societies. In Japan, the estimated prevalence of COPD among individuals aged 40 years and above is 8.6%, while asthma affects about 10% of adults. These statistics highlight the similarities between COPD and asthma in clinical settings. Both diseases involve chronic airway inflammation and present with symptoms such as chronic cough, sputum production, wheezing, and dyspnea. Exacerbations of these symptoms and complications are critical concerns during the perioperative period. COPD, often caused by long-term smoking, leads to irreversible airway and lung damage, while asthma is characterized by episodic and reversible airway constriction due to chronic inflammation. COPD diagnosis involves spirometry and the exclusion of other diseases, with treatment goals focusing on symptom improvement and risk reduction through smoking cessation, pharmacotherapy(mainly bronchodilators), and non-pharmacological methods(such as pulmonary rehabilitation). Asthma management aims to control inflammation and prevent exacerbations using inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators as standard treatments. Perioperative management of both diseases involves improving respiratory function with pharmacotherapy, careful anesthesia selection, and early postoperative mobilization. Consultation with respiratory specialists is recommended for effective management, especially in complex cases.",2024,respiratory

Utilizing the GBD 2021 database, we performed in-depth analyses and preliminary projections of global, regional, and national burden trends for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and interstitial lung disease & pulmonary sarcoidosis (ILD&PS) through multi-model approaches including but not limited to Age-Period-Cohort (APC) models, Joinpoint regression, and Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) modeling. The overall global CRD burden among adults ≥55 years declined from 1990 to 2021. However, the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic differentially altered asthma and COPD prevalence and incidence trends globally: low Socio-demographic Index (SDI) regions experienced an accelerated increase in prevalence, while high SDI regions showed a steeper rise in incidence. High mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates remained concentrated in low-middle SDI regions, notably Asia and North America. Consequently, prevalent CRD cases in this age group reached 223 million (95% UI 206.5-241.5) in 2021-accounting for half of all-age cases-with 18.47 million incident cases (95% UI 16.97-20.11), causing 4.15 million deaths (95% UI 3.76-4.58) and 83.67 million DALYs (95% UI 77.49-90.36). Air pollution, smoking, obesity, and chronic cold exposure persistently influenced COPD and asthma prevalence across regions and sexes.

37656706,Mendelian randomization study shows a causal effect of asthma on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk.,"This study was performed to explore the causal association between asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD). We obtained summary statistics for asthma from 408,442 Europeans in an open genome-wide association study (GWAS) from the UK Biobank to select strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms that could serve as instrumental variables for asthma (P < 5×10-8). Additional summary statistics for COPD were obtained from 193,638 individuals of European ancestry in the GWAS published by FinnGen. Univariable Mendelian randomization(UVMR) analysis was performed using inverse variance weighted (IVW) as the primary method of analysis. The reliability of the results was verified by multivariable MR(MVMR), reverse and replication MR analysis, and sensitivity analysis. In the UVMR analysis, asthma increased the risk of COPD, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.16-1.39, P = 5.44×10-7). Estimates were consistent in MVMR analyses by the adjustments of smoking initiation, age of smoking initiation, cigarettes per day, PM 2.5, and the combination of the above factors. In the reverse MR analysis, there was no evidence of a causal effect of COPD on asthma risk(OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.97-1.07, P = 0.3643). In the replication MR analysis, asthma still increased the risk of COPD. Sensitivity analyses validated the robustness of the above associations. We found that genetically predicted asthma was positively associated with the risk of COPD. Additionally, there was no evidence that COPD increases the risk of asthma. Further clarification of this link and underlying mechanisms is needed to identify feasible measures to promote COPD prevention.",2023,respiratory

Blast-exposed veterans were significantly more likely to report cough (OR 1.8), wheeze (OR 2.4), and dyspnea (OR 1.8), even after adjustment for covariates including smoking and occupational exposures to dust, fume, and gas. Veterans reporting higher severity of blast impact, such as traumatic brain injury or loss of consciousness, were more likely to report cough, wheeze, or dyspnea. Veterans with higher severity of blast impact by multiple measures were also more likely to report having COPD.

39008153,Emotion Regulation Difficulties and Smoking Behavior among Adults with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases.,"COPD is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and results in increased healthcare costs and disability. Smoking is the main determinant of COPD development and continued use increases mortality as compared to those who have stopped smoking. Research has indicated that cigarette smoking may play a role in attempts to regulate distressing emotional experiences and thus, may be an important transdiagnostic process underlying continued smoking behavior among adults with COPD. The current study investigated the role of ER difficulties in relation to smoking status and cigarettes smoked per day among adults with COPD. This cross-sectional study included a sample was adults with COPD (N = 320). Participants self-reported current smoking status, daily smoking, and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, probable depression, probable anxiety, and dyspnea severity. DERS total scores were associated with greater odds of current smoking. With the exception of impulsivity, all other dimensions of emotion regulation were significantly associated with current smoking. Greater difficulties in emotional awareness were associated with greater cigarettes smoked per day. However, neither the DERS total score nor any other dimensions of emotional regulation were significantly associated with cigarettes smoked per day. The present study provides preliminary data linking ER difficulties to smoking behavior among adults with COPD. If corroborated by future research, these findings suggest that ER might be a potential target for smoking cessation programs among adults with COPD.",2024,respiratory
34250960,"Association between socioeconomic status and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Jiangsu province, China: a population-based study.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common public health problem worldwide. Recent studies have reported that socioeconomic status (SES) is related to the incidence of COPD. This study aimed to investigate the association between SES and COPD among adults in Jiangsu province, China, and to determine the possible direct and indirect effects of SES on the morbidity of COPD. A cross-sectional study was conducted among adults aged 40 years and above between May and December of 2015 in Jiangsu province, China. Participants were selected using a multistage sampling approach. COPD, the outcome variable, was diagnosed by physicians based on spirometry, respiratory symptoms, and risk factors. Education, occupation, and monthly family average income (FAI) were used to separately indicate SES as the explanatory variable. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were introduced to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for examining the SES-COPD relationship. A pathway analysis was conducted to further explore the pulmonary function impairment of patients with different SES. The mean age of the 2421 participants was 56.63 ± 9.62 years. The prevalence of COPD was 11.8% (95% CI: 10.5%-13.1%) among the overall sample population. After adjustment for age, gender, residence, outdoor and indoor air pollution, body weight status, cigarette smoking, and potential study area-level clustering effects, educational attainment was negatively associated with COPD prevalence in men; white collars were at lower risk (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.43-0.83) of experiencing COPD than blue collars; compared with those within the lower FAI subgroup, participants in the upper (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49-0.97) tertiles were less likely to experience COPD. Such negative associations between all these three SES indicators and COPD were significant among men only. Education, FAI, and occupation had direct or indirect effects on pulmonary function including post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC), FEV1, FVC, and FEV1 percentage of predicted. Education, FAI, and occupation had indirect effects on pulmonary function indices of all participants mainly through smoking status, indoor air pollution, and outdoor air pollution. We also found that occupation could affect post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC through body mass index. Education, occupation, and FAI had an adverse relationship with COPD prevalence in Jiangsu province, China. SES has both direct and indirect associations with pulmonary function impairment. SES is of great significance for COPD morbidity. It is important that population-based COPD prevention strategies should be tailored for people with different SES.",2021,respiratory
29316890,Risk factors of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients with asthma and COPD.,"Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) in patients with pulmonary diseases remain to be resolved clinical issue. However, most evidence regarding PPC has been established more than 10 years ago. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate perioperative management using new inhalant drugs in patients with obstructive pulmonary diseases. April 2014 through March 2015, 346 adult patients with pulmonary diseases (257 asthma, 89 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) underwent non-pulmonary surgery except cataract surgery in our university hospital. To analyze the risk factors for PPC, we retrospectively evaluated physiological backgrounds, surgical factors and perioperative specific treatment for asthma and COPD. Finally, 29 patients with pulmonary diseases (22 asthma, 7 COPD) had PPC. In patients with asthma, smoking index (≥ 20 pack-years), peripheral blood eosinophil count (≥ 200/mm<sup>3</sup>) and severity (Global INitiative for Asthma(GINA) STEP ≥ 3) were significantly associated with PPC in the multivariate logistic regression analysis [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 5.4(1.4-20.8), 0.31 (0.11-0.84) and 3.2 (1.04-9.9), respectively]. In patients with COPD, age, introducing treatment for COPD, upper abdominal surgery and operation time (≥ 5 h) were significantly associated with PPC [1.18 (1.00-1.40), 0.09 (0.01-0.81), 21.2 (1.3-349) and 9.5 (1.2-77.4), respectively]. History of smoking or severe asthma is a risk factor of PPC in patients with asthma, and age, upper abdominal surgery, or long operation time is a risk factor of PPC in patients with COPD. Adequate inhaled corticosteroids treatment in patients with eosinophilic asthma and introducing treatment for COPD in patients with COPD could reduce PPCs.",2018,respiratory
32588373,Profile of Cardiovascular Disease Patients Who are Diagnosed with COPD in a Smoking-Cessation Unit.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have similar prevalence rates and risk factors, and both frequently occur in the same patient. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the rate of COPD patients among subjects with some form of CVD referring to a smoking cessation unit. The secondary objective was to analyze the demographic and clinical profile of these subjects and to identify independent factors potentially associated with COPD. Observational, prospective study involving 132 patients with smoking habits, and some form of CVD, referring to the smoking cessation unit at the Pulmonology Department of the University Hospital of Cáceres, Spain, between October 2015 and March 2017. A total of 58 patients (43.9%) were diagnosed with COPD. Main CVDs were: ischemic heart disease (76.5%), chronic heart failure (24.8%), peripheral arterial disease (18.5%), and atrial fibrillation (7.6%). Independent factors were: pack-years (> 30 versus < 30; odds ratio, OR 5.3; 95% CI 1.3-21.4); forced expiratory volume in the first second (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.9-1.0); chronic heart failure (yes versus no; OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.3-16.4); and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea (2-3 versus 0; OR 18.7; 95% CI 1.9-182.0). Four of ten patients with some form of CVD also experience COPD. Dyspnea, airflow limitation, smoking habits, and chronic heart failure were significant factors associated with COPD in patients with CVD. Smoking cessation units are useful to improve the diagnosis of COPD in these patients. Further prospective studies with a greater cohort of patients are required to corroborate the present results and to enhance the knowledge of the clinical profile of these patients.",2020,respiratory
26229460,"Smoking duration, respiratory symptoms, and COPD in adults aged ≥45 years with a smoking history.","The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship of smoking duration with respiratory symptoms and history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the South Carolina Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey in 2012. Data from 4,135 adults aged ≥45 years with a smoking history were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression that accounted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, and current smoking status, as well as the complex sampling design. The distribution of smoking duration ranged from 19.2% (1-9 years) to 36.2% (≥30 years). Among 1,454 respondents who had smoked for ≥30 years, 58.3% were current smokers, 25.0% had frequent productive cough, 11.2% had frequent shortness of breath, 16.7% strongly agreed that shortness of breath affected physical activity, and 25.6% had been diagnosed with COPD. Prevalence of COPD and each respiratory symptom was lower among former smokers who quit ≥10 years earlier compared with current smokers. Smoking duration had a linear relationship with COPD (P<0.001) and all three respiratory symptoms (P<0.001) after adjusting for smoking status and other covariates. While COPD prevalence increased with prolonged smoking duration in both men and women, women had a higher age-adjusted prevalence of COPD in the 1-9 years, 20-29 years, and ≥30 years duration periods. These state population data confirm that prolonged tobacco use is associated with respiratory symptoms and COPD after controlling for current smoking behavior.",2015,respiratory
40290584,Treatable Traits in Patients with Obstructive Lung Diseases in a Well-Established Asthma/COPD Service for Primary Care.,"The primary objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of treatable traits (TTs) in patients with obstructive lung diseases in a primary care setting and how these TTs co-occur. The secondary objective was to assess the stability of TTs and the effect of management advice on changes in traits and health outcomes. Data from the Dutch asthma/COPD service (2007-2023) were studied retrospectively. Patients ≥18 years with asthma, COPD, or Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) were included. The prevalence of eight TTs were assessed: 1) insufficient inhaler technique, 2) poor medication adherence, 3) blood eosinophilia, 4) smoking, 5) obesity, 6) physical inactivity, 7) reversible airflow limitation, and 8) anxiety and/or depression. The effect of management advice on TTs was evaluated for patients with a follow-up visit scheduled within 1-2 years. In total, 15246 patients (COPD n=4822; ACO n=1761, asthma n=8663) were included. The highest proportions of TTs were insufficient inhaler technique: 43.6% (95% CI: 42.9-44.4), followed by poor medication adherence: 40.3% (95% CI: 39.2-41.4) and blood eosinophilia: 36.9% (95% CI: 35.8-38.1). Overall, 83.3% of patients had ≥ 1 TTs, and 48.9% of patients ≥ 2 TTs. Among patients with blood eosinophilia, a significant reduction of the trait at follow-up (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39; 0.96) and improved health status were observed when the pulmonologist advised the general practitioner to initiate or increase the dose of ICS. No significant association was found between management advice and the exacerbation rate at follow-up. The TTs assessed in this study are common in primary care patients, with nearly half of the patients showing a combination of at least two TTs. These TTs coexist in many different combinations. A personalized approach targeting these traits may be effective in achieving better control of these heterogeneous diseases.",2025,respiratory
33177817,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Incidence of Hip Fracture: A Nested Case-Control Study in the EpiChron Cohort.,"To determine whether chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a risk factor for hip fracture and identify other factors associated with hip fracture. Observational nested case-control study was conducted in Aragon, Spain in 2010. We included COPD patients aged >40 years, in the EpiChron cohort. Each COPD patient was matched for age, sex, and number of comorbidities with a control subject without COPD. Patients with an existing diagnosis of osteoporosis and those with hip fracture before 2011 were excluded. We collected baseline demographic, comorbidity, and pharmacological treatment data. During a 5-year follow-up period, we recorded the incidence of hip fracture. A logistic regression model was constructed to identify factors associated with hip fracture. The study population consisted of 26,517 COPD patients and the same number of controls (median [interquartile range] age, 74 [17] years; women, 24.7%). Smoking and heart failure were more frequent in COPD patients, and obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, stroke, arthritis, and visual or hearing impairment were less frequent (all p<0.001). Consumption of benzodiazepines (p=0.037), bronchodilators (p<0.001), and corticosteroids (p<0.001) was higher in the COPD group, while that of beta-blockers and thiazides was lower (both p<0.001). During follow-up, 898 (1.7%) patients experienced hip fracture, with no differences observed between COPD and control patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that independent of COPD status, age, female sex, chronic liver disease, heart failure, and benzodiazepine use were independently associated with a higher risk of hip fracture, and obesity with a lower risk. In COPD patients, use of inhaled anticholinergics was independently associated with hip fracture (OR, 1.390; 95% CI 1.134-1.702; p=0.001). COPD is not a risk factor for a hip fracture within 5 years. The association between the use of inhaled anticholinergics and risk of hip fracture warrants further study.",2020,respiratory
31341890,"Cigarette Smoke Induced Lung Barrier Dysfunction, EMT, and Tissue Remodeling: A Possible Link between COPD and Lung Cancer.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, closely related to smoking, are major lung diseases affecting millions of individuals worldwide. The generated gas mixture of smoking is proved to contain about 4,500 components such as carbon monoxide, nicotine, oxidants, fine particulate matter, and aldehydes. These components were considered to be the principle factor driving the pathogenesis and progression of pulmonary disease. A large proportion of lung cancer patients showed a history of COPD, which demonstrated that there might be a close relationship between COPD and lung cancer. In the early stages of smoking, lung barrier provoked protective response and DNA repair are likely to suppress these changes to a certain extent. In the presence of long-term smoking exposure, these mechanisms seem to be malfunctioned and lead to disease progression. The infiltration of inflammatory cells to mucosa, submucosa, and glandular tissue caused by inhaled cigarette smoke is responsible for the destruction of matrix, blood supply shortage, and epithelial cell death. Conversely, cancer cells have the capacity to modulate the proliferation of epithelial cells and produce of new vascular networks. Comprehension understanding of mechanisms responsible for both pathologies is necessary for the prevention and treatment of COPD and lung cancer. In this review, we will summarize related articles and give a glance of possible mechanism between cigarette smoking induced COPD and lung cancer.",2019,respiratory
38336742,The AGE-RAGE axis associates with chronic pulmonary diseases and smoking in the Rotterdam study.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma associate with high morbidity and mortality. High levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were found in tissue and plasma of COPD patients but their role in COPD and asthma is unclear. In the Rotterdam Study (n = 2577), AGEs (by skin autofluorescence (SAF)), FEV<sub>1</sub> and lung diffusing capacity (D<sub>LCO</sub>c and D<sub>LCO</sub>c /alveolar volume [V<sub>A</sub>]) were measured. Associations of SAF with asthma, COPD, GOLD stage, and lung function were analyzed using logistic and linear regression adjusted for covariates, followed by interaction and stratification analyses. sRAGE and EN-RAGE associations with COPD prevalence were analyzed by logistic regression. SAF associated with COPD prevalence (OR = 1.299 [1.060, 1.591]) but not when adjusted for smoking (OR = 1.106 [0.89, 1.363]). SAF associated with FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted (β=-3.384 [-4.877, -1.892]), D<sub>LCO</sub>c (β=-0.212 [-0.327, -0.097]) and GOLD stage (OR = 4.073, p = 0.001, stage 3&4 versus 1). Stratified, the association between SAF and FEV<sub>1</sub>%predicted was stronger in COPD (β=-6.362 [-9.055, -3.670]) than non-COPD (β=-1.712 [-3.306, -0.118]). Association of SAF with D<sub>LCO</sub>c and D<sub>LCO</sub>c/V<sub>A</sub> were confined to COPD (β=-0.550 [-0.909, -0.191]; β=-0.065 [-0.117, -0.014] respectively). SAF interacted with former smoking and COPD prevalence for associations with lung function. Lower sRAGE and higher EN-RAGE associated with COPD prevalence (OR = 0.575[0.354, 0.931]; OR = 1.778[1.142, 2.768], respectively). Associations between SAF, lung function and COPD prevalence were strongly influenced by smoking. SAF associated with COPD severity and its association with lung function was more prominent within COPD. These results fuel further research into interrelations and causality between SAF, smoking and COPD.

27232203,"Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): An Ecological Study in the Basque Country, Spain (2000-2011).","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent condition in adults aged ≥40 years characterized by progressive airflow limitation associated with chronic inflammatory response to noxious particles in the airways and lungs. Smoking, genetics, air pollution, nutrition and other factors may influence COPD development. Most hospitalizations and deaths for COPD are caused by its acute exacerbations, which greatly affect the health and quality of life of COPD patients and pose a high burden on health services. The aims of this project were to identify trends, geographic patterns and risk factors for COPD exacerbations, as revealed by hospitalizations and deaths, in the Basque Country, Spain, over a period of 12 years (2000-2011). Hospitalization and mortality rates for COPD were 262 and 18 per 100,000 population, respectively, with clusters around the biggest cities. Hospital mortality was 7.4%. Most hospitalized patients were male (77.4%) and accounted for 72.1% of hospital mortality. Hospitalizations decreased during the study period, except for 50-64 year-old women, peaking significantly. Using a multivariate modeling approach it was shown that hospitalizations were positively correlated with increased atmospheric concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, PM<sub>10</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub>, and increased influenza incidence, but were negatively associated with increased temperatures and atmospheric O<sub>3</sub> concentration. COPD exacerbations decreased in the Basque Country during 2000-2011, but not among 50-64-year-old women, reflecting the high smoking prevalence among Spanish women during the 1970-1990s. The main metropolitan areas were those with the highest risk for COPD exacerbations, calling attention to the role of heavy car traffic. Influenza virus, cold temperatures, and increased atmospheric NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, PM<sub>10</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> (but decreased O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations were identified as potential contributors to the burden of COPD exacerbations in the community. These findings are important for both the understanding of the disease process and in providing potential targets for COPD-reducing initiatives and new avenues for research.",2016,respiratory
25102970,Plasma miRNAs might be promising biomarkers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"We previously showed that microRNAs (miRNAs) in plasma are potential biomarkers for cigarette smoking-related lung fibrosis. Here, we want to find out promising miRNAs for early detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Plasma miRNAs profiling was performed in COPD patients, asthma patients, and matched healthy controls. There was a >2-fold changes for all signature miRNAs between the COPD and control samples, with P values of < 0.05. Pathway analysis, taking into account enriched target mRNAs for these signature miRNAs, was also carried out. We found seven miRNAs were special expression in the COPD patients. Furthermore, changes of miR-145-5p, miR-338-3p and miR-3620-3p were consistent with the classification of new ABCD classification of COPD. Targeted gene promising proved those miRNAs acted in inflammatory mediators, regulation of proliferation and differentiation, oxidative stress and so on.

25646333,Fish intake and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2 large US cohorts.,"Despite mechanistic data that linked fish and omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs with lower risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), epidemiologic data remain scarce. Fish and n-3 PUFAs are an important component of the prudent dietary pattern that is thought to be protective in the onset of COPD. We examined the role of fish and PUFA intakes on risk of developing COPD while taking into account the overall dietary pattern. We investigated the objective in 120,175 women and men from the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Over the study period (1984-2000), there were 889 cases of newly diagnosed COPD. Cumulative average intakes of fish, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, n-3 PUFAs, n-6 PUFAs, and the n-3:n-6 ratio were calculated from repeated food-frequency questionnaires. Because fish is a food group included in the prudent pattern, we derived a new prudent pattern without the contribution from fish, and we termed this pattern the ""modified prudent"" pattern. We performed multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Before the dietary pattern was taken into account, and with 14 factors controlled for, we showed that more-frequent fish intake (≥4 servings/wk) was inversely associated with risk of COPD [adjusted pooled HR for the highest intake compared with the lowest intake (<1 serving/wk): 0.71; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.94]. After additional adjustment for the dietary pattern (modified prudent and Western patterns), the association was NS (0.84; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.13). No significant associations were shown between PUFA intakes and risk of COPD. Although COPD-prevention efforts should continue to focus on smoking cessation, these prospective findings support the importance of promoting a healthy diet in multi-interventional programs to prevent COPD instead of focusing on changes in an isolated food or nutrient.",2015,respiratory

With rising obesity rates, understanding its effects on respiratory health is increasingly essential. We aimed to evaluate IOS parameters as predictors of respiratory dysfunction across different BMI categories, offering insights into managing complex cases involving obesity and lung disease. We retrospectively analyzed IOS data from 1,947 patients referred to a secondary care allergy and lung clinic. IOS parameters assessed included total and peripheral airway resistance (R<sub>5</sub> and R<sub>5-20</sub>), resonant frequency (Fres), and reactance area (A<sub>X</sub>), examined relative to BMI. The cohort included patients with asthma, COPD, other lung diseases, and controls. A weighted random forest model was used to assess the impact of IOS parameters on BMI prediction accuracy, adjusting for imbalances in BMI and disease groups. Obesity significantly affected IOS parameters, with R<sub>5-20</sub>, A<sub>X</sub>, and Fres emerging as key markers across all diagnostic groups. Elevated R<sub>5-20</sub>, A<sub>X</sub> and Fres values in obese patients, regardless of lung disease status, indicated increased small airway resistance and dysfunction. These IOS features demonstrated high predictive value in BMI-related outcomes, suggesting they capture airway impairments tied to obesity beyond conventional respiratory diagnoses. IOS parameters, particularly R<sub>5-20</sub>, A<sub>X</sub>, and Fres are sensitive to obesity-associated airway changes and may serve as valuable markers for identifying respiratory impairment in obese individuals with or without lung disease.",2025,respiratory
33244228,The Value of Inflammatory Biomarkers in Differentiating Asthma-COPD Overlap from COPD.,"To evaluate the accuracy of inflammatory biomarkers in differentiating patients with asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) from those with COPD alone. Clinical data of 134 patients with COPD and 48 patients with ACO admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from January 2016 to June 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the best cut-off values of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), blood eosinophil counts (EOS), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for differentiating between ACO and COPD alone. Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationships between these inflammatory biomarkers and the forced expiratory volume in one second/prediction (FEV<sub>1</sub>%pred). FeNO and EOS in the ACO patients were significantly higher than those in the COPD patients (FeNO: median 37.50 vs 24.50 ppb, <i>P</i> < 0.001; EOS: median 0.20 vs 0.10 ×10<sup>9</sup>/L, <i>P</i> = 0.004). FeNO was positively correlated with FEV<sub>1</sub>%pred (r = 0.314, <i>P</i> = 0.030), while NLR was negatively correlated with FEV<sub>1</sub>%pred (r = -0.372, <i>P</i> = 0.009) in patients with ACO. In addition, a positive correlation between FeNO and EOS was also found in ACO, especially in patients without history of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) use (r = 0.682, <i>P</i> < 0.001). The optimal cut-off value of FeNO was 31.5 ppb (AUC = 0.758, 95% CI = 0.631-0.886) in patients with smoking history, with 70.0% sensitivity and 89.9% specificity for differentiating ACO from COPD. In patients without history of ICS use, the best cut-off value of FeNO was 39.5 ppb (AUC = 0.740, 95% CI = 0.610-0.870), with 58.3% sensitivity and 84.9% specificity. Among patients without history of ICS use and smoking, 27.5 ppb was optimal cut-off level for FeNO (AUC = 0.744, 95% CI = 0.579-0.908) to diagnose ACO, with 81.8% sensitivity and 60.7% specificity, and the sensitivity was improved to 91.7% when FeNO was combined with EOS.

26952279,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cognitive impairment in the Chinese elderly population: a large national survey.,"Previous studies suggested an association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cognitive impairment, mostly in developed countries. There is no evidence available on the association between these two common chronic disorders in the elderly people in People's Republic of China where the population is aging rapidly. The study population was randomly selected from a nationally representative Disease Surveillance Point System in People's Republic of China. A standardized questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers during a face-to-face interview in the field survey conducted in 2010-2011. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. COPD was measured by self-report and the Medical Research Council respiratory questionnaire was used to assess respiratory symptoms. A multivariate logistic regression model was applied to examine the association between COPD and cognitive impairment with adjustment for potential confounding factors. A total of 16,629 subjects aged over 60 years were included in the study. The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 9.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.7, 11.1). Chronic phlegm was associated with significantly higher prevalence of cognitive impairment in models adjusted for age, sex, marital status, geographic region, urban/rural, education, smoking status, alcohol drinking, and indoor air pollution (odds ratio [OR] 1.46, 95% CI 1.11, 1.93).

30339246,Independent and combined associations of maternal and own smoking with adult lung function and COPD.,"Limited evidence suggests that exposure to maternal smoking in utero or early life might be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but whether this is independent of later own smoking remains unclear. Our objective was to examine the independent and combined association of maternal and own smoking with adult lung function and COPD. We used UK Biobank to examine associations of maternal smoking around delivery, and pack-years of own smoking, with lung function (n = 502 626) and hospitalization/death from COPD (n = 433 863). We calculated the additive interaction between maternal and own smoking on the outcomes of interest, and estimated the association with maternal smoking within categories of own smoking. There was no strong evidence that maternal smoking influenced adult lung health among never smokers. Exposure to both maternal and own smoking was associated with lower Forced expiratory volume (FEV1)/ forced vital capacity (FVC) and greater risk of hospitalization/death from COPD than expected from their independent associations. For FEV1/FVC, the mean difference according to maternal smoking was -0.02 (-0.06, 0.02), -0.01 (-0.05, 0.03), -0.11 (-0.16, -0.05) and -0.11 (-0.19, -0.04) among women who smoked ≤10, 11-20, 21-30 and >30 pack-years, respectively. The association between maternal smoking and COPD also varied by pack-years of own smoking, with a hazard ratio of 2.25 (1.30, 3.89) for ≤10 years, 1.23 (0.80, 1.89) for 11-20 years, 1.30 (0.85, 2.01) for 21-30 years and 1.14 (0.91, 1.43) for >30 years.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been reported due to increased particulate matter related air pollution episodes. Considering the profound functional, anatomical and structural changes occurring in COPD lungs, the relevance of the existing <i>in silico</i> models for mimicking diseased lungs warrants reevaluation. Currently available computational modeling tools were developed for the healthy adult (male) lung. Here, we analyze the major alterations occurring in the airway structure, anatomy and pulmonary function in the COPD lung, as compared to the healthy lung. We also scrutinize the various physiological and particle characteristics that influence particle deposition, distribution and clearance in the lung. The aim of this review is to evaluate the availability of the fundamental knowledge and data required for modeling particle deposition in a COPD lung departing from the existing healthy lung models. The extent to which COPD pathophysiology may affect aerosol deposition depends on the relative contribution of several factors such as altered lung structure and function, bronchoconstriction, emphysema, loss of elastic recoil, altered breathing pattern and altered liquid volumes that warrant consideration while developing physiologically relevant <i>in silico</i> models.",2019,respiratory
37392082,"Long-term effects of air pollution on hospital admissions and mortality for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Beijing, China.","We aimed to clarify the association between air pollution and hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and mortality in Beijing, China. In this retrospective study, we recruited 510 COPD patients from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2009. The patient data were obtained from the electronic medical records of Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing. Air pollution and meteorological data were obtained from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Monthly COPD hospital admissions, mortality and air pollution data were analysed using Poisson regression in generalised additive models adjusted for mean temperature, pressure and relative humidity. There were positive correlations between sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub> ), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm (PM<sub>10</sub> ) and COPD hospital admissions in the single-pollutant model. An increase of 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> in SO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> were associated with an increase of 4.053% (95% CI: 1.470-5.179%) and 1.401% (95%CI: 0.6656-1.850%) in COPD hospital admissions. In the multiple-pollutant model [SO<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub> ) combinations], there was only a positive correlation between SO<sub>2</sub> and COPD hospital admissions. An increase of 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> in SO<sub>2</sub> were associated with an increase of 1.916% (95% CI: 1.118-4.286%) in COPD hospital admissions. There was no correlation between three pollutant combinations and COPD hospital admissions. We did not find correlations between air pollution and COPD mortality in either single- or multiple-pollutant models. SO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> may be important factors for the increase in COPD hospital admissions in Beijing, China.",2023,respiratory
30923493,Effects of Aging and Smoking Duration on Cigarette Smoke-Induced COPD Severity.,"Aging can serve as an underlying mechanism of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Also, smoking, which is the most common cause of COPD, is responsible for the systemic manifestations of the disease, independently from the lung function alterations. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of aging on the occurrence of cigarette smoking induced COPD. For this analysis, we evaluated smoking status by a lifestyle intervention program and measured the occurrence of COPD by the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) from 2005 to 2015. Aging and smoking were significantly effected on the lung function of COPD patients. Especially, the smoking duration is exaggerated in the presence of old age for older COPD patients. The result showed that COPD patients exhibit aging and smoking duration related severity. The prevalence of COPD kept increasing internationally. Knowing the risk factor of COPD quantitatively and finding out the interaction among risk factors could be valuable predictors for preventing COPD.",2019,respiratory
28057131,[Interaction between smoking and indoor air pollution on chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases].,"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) in Tongxiang, Zhejiang province, and analyze the interaction between smoking and indoor air pollution on COPD. <b>Methods:</b> Townships of Chongfu, Zhouquan, Gaoqiao, Shimen, Wuzhen were randomly selected from Tongxiang. All the local people aged 30-79 years were asked to receive questionnaire survey, physical examination and pulmonary function testing. FEV<sub>1</sub>max/FVC max≤0.7 was the criterion of COPD diagnosis. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between smoking/indoor air pollution and COPD, multiplied interaction between smoking and indoor air pollution was evaluated, Excel table prepared by Andersson et al. was used to calculate the adding interaction. <b>Results:</b> The overall prevalence of COPD was 6.6%, and adjusted for age, educational level, occupation, marriage, income level, BMI, waist-to-hip and other factors, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that males who had quit smoking, started smoking at age of <25 years had a high risk of COPD; females who smoked every day <15 g, inhaled smoke into mouth or throat had high risk of COPD. Interaction analysis showed that using fuel of firewood/charcoal/coal, briquettes for cooking and regular smoking had multiplied interaction on COPD. Use no chimney or exhaust system in cooking and regular smoking had adding interaction in females. <b>Conclusion:</b> The prevalence of COPD in Tongxiang was close to the national average level. Female smokers had higher risk for COPD than male smokers. Improving kitchen ventilation, using natural gas or fuel gas for cooking and active tobacco control would facilitate the prevention of COPD.",2016,respiratory
