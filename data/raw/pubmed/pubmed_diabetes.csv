29219149,Global aetiology and epidemiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications.,"Globally, the number of people with diabetes mellitus has quadrupled in the past three decades, and diabetes mellitus is the ninth major cause of death. About 1 in 11 adults worldwide now have diabetes mellitus, 90% of whom have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Asia is a major area of the rapidly emerging T2DM global epidemic, with China and India the top two epicentres. Although genetic predisposition partly determines individual susceptibility to T2DM, an unhealthy diet and a sedentary lifestyle are important drivers of the current global epidemic; early developmental factors (such as intrauterine exposures) also have a role in susceptibility to T2DM later in life. Many cases of T2DM could be prevented with lifestyle changes, including maintaining a healthy body weight, consuming a healthy diet, staying physically active, not smoking and drinking alcohol in moderation. Most patients with T2DM have at least one complication, and cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. This Review provides an updated view of the global epidemiology of T2DM, as well as dietary, lifestyle and other risk factors for T2DM and its complications.",2018,diabetes
32726990,"Mediterranean Diet Effects on Type 2 Diabetes Prevention, Disease Progression, and Related Mechanisms. A Review.","The search for a quality diet has grown over the past decade. Diet is considered one of the pillars for the prevention and progression of several diseases, among them: diabetes. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an epidemic of western countries that increases the vulnerability of other diseases, such as cardiovascular and cancer. T2D is associated with lifestyle and diet. The traditional Mediterranean diet has proven its benefits over several cardiovascular risk factors, and specifically on diabetes. This review compiles recent published evidence on the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the incidence and progression of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its relation with several other cardiovascular healthy diets. We will also focus on how the Mediterranean diet could play a role in T2D-related mechanisms, such as anti-inflammatory or antioxidant compounds, glucagon-like peptide agonist compounds, and changes in gut microbiota. Each component of the Mediterranean diet could be involved in processes related to diabetes homeostasis, many of them sharing common physio-pathological pathways. The importance of this diet within the set of habits of a healthy lifestyle must be emphasized.",2020,diabetes
36786838,"Embracing complexity: making sense of diet, nutrition, obesity and type 2 diabetes.","Nutrition therapy has been emphasised for decades for people with type 2 diabetes, and the vital importance of diet and nutrition is now also recognised for type 2 diabetes prevention. However, the complexity of diet and mixed messages on what is unhealthy, healthy or optimal have led to confusion among people with diabetes and their physicians as well as the general public. What should people eat for the prevention, management and remission of type 2 diabetes? Recently, progress has been made in research evidence that has advanced our understanding in several areas of past uncertainty. This article examines some of these issues, focusing on the role of diet in weight management and in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. It considers nutritional strategies including low-energy, low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets, discusses inter-relationships between nutrients, foods and dietary patterns, and examines aspects of quantity and quality together with new developments, challenges and future directions.",2023,diabetes
32899917,Preventive Role of Diet Interventions and Dietary Factors in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: An Umbrella Review.,"Although the body of evidence indicates clear benefits of dietary modifications for prevention of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it may be difficult for healthcare providers to recommend which diet interventions or dietary factors are appropriate for patients as there are too many modalities available. Accordingly, we performed an umbrella review to synthesize evidence on diet interventions and dietary factors in prevention of T2DM. Medline and Scopus databases were searched for relevant studies. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomized-controlled trial or observational studies were eligible if they measured effects of diet interventions and/or dietary factors including dietary patterns, food groups, and nutrients on risk of T2DM. The effect of each diet intervention/factor was summarized qualitatively. Sixty systematic reviews and meta-analyses were eligible. Results of the review suggest that healthy dietary patterns such as Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets, and high consumption of whole grains, low-fat dairy products, yogurt, olive oil, chocolate, fiber, magnesium, and flavonoid significantly reduced the risk of T2DM. In contrast, high glycemic index and glycemic load diets, high consumption of red and processed meat, and sugar or artificial sugar-sweetened beverages significantly increased risk of T2DM. Prescribing diet interventions with or without physical activity interventions significantly decreased risk of T2DM in both high-risk and general population. High consumption of Mediterranean and DASH diet, and interventions that modified the quality of diet intake significantly reduced risk of T2DM especially in the high-risk population. These lifestyle modifications should be promoted in both individual and population levels to prevent and decrease burden from T2DM in the future.",2020,diabetes
34444908,Nutrition in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: Present Knowledge and Remaining Challenges.,"Unhealthy behaviours, including diet and physical activity, coupled with genetic predisposition, drive type 2 diabetes (T2D) occurrence and severity; the present review aims to summarise the most recent nutritional approaches in T2D, outlining unmet needs. Guidelines consistently suggest reducing energy intake to counteract the obesity epidemic, frequently resulting in sarcopenic obesity, a condition associated with poorer metabolic control and cardiovascular disease. Various dietary approaches have been proposed with largely similar results, with a preference for the Mediterranean diet and the best practice being the diet that patients feel confident of maintaining in the long term based on individual preferences. Patient adherence is indeed the pivotal factor for weight loss and long-term maintenance, requiring intensive lifestyle intervention. The consumption of nutritional supplements continues to increase even if international societies do not support their systematic use. Inositols and vitamin D supplementation, as well as micronutrients (zinc, chromium, magnesium) and pre/probiotics, result in modest improvement in insulin sensitivity, but their use is not systematically suggested. To reach the desired goals, patients should be actively involved in the collaborative development of a personalised meal plan associated with habitual physical activity, aiming at normal body weight and metabolic control.",2021,diabetes
36480153,The effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for diabetes remission on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Conventional wisdom affirmed that diabetes was irreversible, but current research shows that lifestyle interventions may achieve diabetes remission among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recently, many original studies have examined the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions. However, great heterogeneity in intervention approaches resulted in inconsistent intervention effects. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for diabetes remission among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant articles from their inceptions to March 26, 2021. Reference lists and a relevant journal were searched manually as well. Both randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies were included. The quantitative data extracted from the selected studies included diabetes remission rate, weight, and quality of life score. The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane and Joanna Briggs Institute's tool. RevMan version 5.3. was used to carry out the meta-analysis. This systematic review included 12 studies involving 3997 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lifestyle interventions included in the studies were mainly divided into diet-only interventions and diet combined with physical activity interventions. Among them, there were three types of diet: (1) low-energy diet, (2) low carbohydrate diet, and (3) Mediterranean diet. Moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance physical activity, walking, and maintaining habitual physical activity were the three types of physical activity interventions employed in the included studies. The results indicated that lifestyle interventions were effective for achieving diabetes remission, reducing weight, and improving quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lifestyle interventions were associated with significant effects on diabetes remission, reducing weight, and improving quality of life. As an important part of lifestyle interventions, diet and physical activity have a significant effect on blood glucose and weight control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is therefore suggested that the contents of lifestyle interventions should focus on diet and physical activity.",2023,diabetes
28720102,Environmental/lifestyle factors in the pathogenesis and prevention of type 2 diabetes.,"Environmental and lifestyle changes, in addition to the ageing of populations, are generally believed to account for the rapid global increase in type 2 diabetes prevalence and incidence in recent decades. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of factors contributing to diabetes risk, including aspects of diet quality and quantity, little physical activity, increased monitor viewing time or sitting in general, exposure to noise or fine dust, short or disturbed sleep, smoking, stress and depression, and a low socioeconomic status. In general, these factors promote an increase in body mass index. Since loss of β-cell function is the ultimate cause of developing overt type 2 diabetes, environmental and lifestyle changes must have resulted in a higher risk of β-cell damage in those at genetic risk. Multiple mechanistic pathways may come into play. Strategies of diabetes prevention should aim at promoting a 'diabetes-protective lifestyle' whilst simultaneously enhancing the resistance of the human organism to pro-diabetic environmental and lifestyle factors. More research on diabetes-protective mechanisms seems warranted.",2017,diabetes
35595477,Risk Factors and Lifestyle Interventions.,"There are many nonmodifiable and modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Nonmodifiable risk factors include age, genetics, epigenetics, and social determinants of health (including education level, socioeconomic status, and noise and arsenic exposure). Modifiable risk factors include obesity, the microbiome, diet, cigarette smoking, sleep duration, sleep quality, and sedentary behavior. Major lifestyle interventions to prevent and treat diabetes relate to these risk factors. Weight loss is the lifestyle intervention with the largest benefit for both preventing and treating diabetes. Exercise, even without weight loss, significantly reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes.",2022,diabetes
28708478,Diabetes with obesity--Is there an ideal diet?,"For individuals who are overweight or obese, weight loss is effective in preventing and improving the management of type 2 diabetes. Together with other lifestyle factors like exercise and behavior modification, diet plays a central role in achieving weight loss. Diets vary based on the type and amount of carbohydrate, fat, and protein consumed to meet daily caloric intake goals. A number of popular diets are reviewed as well as studies evaluating the effect of various diets on weight loss, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors. Current trends favor the low-carbohydrate, low-glycemic index, Mediterranean, and very-low-calorie diets. However, no optimal dietary strategy exists for patients with obesity and diabetes, and more research is needed. Given the wide range of dietary choices, the best diet is one that achieves the best adherence based on the patient's dietary preferences, energy needs, and health status.",2017,diabetes
34792619,Environmental risk factors of type 2 diabetes-an exposome approach.,"Type 2 diabetes is one of the major chronic diseases accounting for a substantial proportion of disease burden in Western countries. The majority of the burden of type 2 diabetes is attributed to environmental risks and modifiable risk factors such as lifestyle. The environment we live in, and changes to it, can thus contribute substantially to the prevention of type 2 diabetes at a population level. The 'exposome' represents the (measurable) totality of environmental, i.e. nongenetic, drivers of health and disease. The external exposome comprises aspects of the built environment, the social environment, the physico-chemical environment and the lifestyle/food environment. The internal exposome comprises measurements at the epigenetic, transcript, proteome, microbiome or metabolome level to study either the exposures directly, the imprints these exposures leave in the biological system, the potential of the body to combat environmental insults and/or the biology itself. In this review, we describe the evidence for environmental risk factors of type 2 diabetes, focusing on both the general external exposome and imprints of this on the internal exposome. Studies provided established associations of air pollution, residential noise and area-level socioeconomic deprivation with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, while neighbourhood walkability and green space are consistently associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. There is little or inconsistent evidence on the contribution of the food environment, other aspects of the social environment and outdoor temperature. These environmental factors are thought to affect type 2 diabetes risk mainly through mechanisms incorporating lifestyle factors such as physical activity or diet, the microbiome, inflammation or chronic stress. To further assess causality of these associations, future studies should focus on investigating the longitudinal effects of our environment (and changes to it) in relation to type 2 diabetes risk and whether these associations are explained by these proposed mechanisms.",2022,diabetes
29433995,Precision nutrition for prevention and management of type 2 diabetes.,"Precision nutrition aims to prevent and manage chronic diseases by tailoring dietary interventions or recommendations to one or a combination of an individual's genetic background, metabolic profile, and environmental exposures. Recent advances in genomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome technologies have offered opportunities as well as challenges in the use of precision nutrition to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes. Nutrigenomics studies have identified genetic variants that influence intake and metabolism of specific nutrients and predict individuals' variability in response to dietary interventions. Metabolomics has revealed metabolomic fingerprints of food and nutrient consumption and uncovered new metabolic pathways that are potentially modified by diet. Dietary interventions have been successful in altering abundance, composition, and activity of gut microbiota that are relevant for food metabolism and glycaemic control. In addition, mobile apps and wearable devices facilitate real-time assessment of dietary intake and provide feedback which can improve glycaemic control and diabetes management. By integrating these technologies with big data analytics, precision nutrition has the potential to provide personalised nutrition guidance for more effective prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Despite these technological advances, much research is needed before precision nutrition can be widely used in clinical and public health settings. Currently, the field of precision nutrition faces challenges including a lack of robust and reproducible results, the high cost of omics technologies, and methodological issues in study design as well as high-dimensional data analyses and interpretation. Evidence is needed to support the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and additional benefits of precision nutrition beyond traditional nutrition intervention approaches. Therefore, we should manage unrealistically high expectations and balance the emerging field of precision nutrition with public health nutrition strategies to improve diet quality and prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications.",2018,diabetes
29194424,Functional Foods and Lifestyle Approaches for Diabetes Prevention and Management.,"Functional foods contain biologically active ingredients associated with physiological health benefits for preventing and managing chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A regular consumption of functional foods may be associated with enhanced anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, insulin sensitivity, and anti-cholesterol functions, which are considered integral to prevent and manage T2DM. Components of the Mediterranean diet (MD)-such as fruits, vegetables, oily fish, olive oil, and tree nuts-serve as a model for functional foods based on their natural contents of nutraceuticals, including polyphenols, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, sterols, pigments, and unsaturated fatty acids. Polyphenols within MD and polyphenol-rich herbs-such as coffee, green tea, black tea, and yerba maté-have shown clinically-meaningful benefits on metabolic and microvascular activities, cholesterol and fasting glucose lowering, and anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation in high-risk and T2DM patients. However, combining exercise with functional food consumption can trigger and augment several metabolic and cardiovascular protective benefits, but it is under-investigated in people with T2DM and bariatric surgery patients. Detecting functional food benefits can now rely on an ""omics"" biological profiling of individuals' molecular, genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, but is under-investigated in multi-component interventions. A personalized approach for preventing and managing T2DM should consider biological and behavioral models, and embed nutrition education as part of lifestyle diabetes prevention studies. Functional foods may provide additional benefits in such an approach.",2017,diabetes
36029440,Type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents: distinct characteristics and evidence-based management.,"Since the dramatic rise of obesity prevalence in childhood and adolescence has contributed to increased rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth, we sought to explore current evidence-based management options for pediatric T2D patients. A comprehensive literature search was performed for studies of T2D in childhood and adolescence until September 2021. Special pathophysiological and diagnostic characteristics of T2D in this age are presented, while the main focus of the article is on management. Lifestyle interventions with healthy diet and exercise are of great importance for the treatment of T2D in children and adolescents. Metformin and insulin remain the traditional therapeutical means, while liraglutide recently gained indication for children older than 10 years both in USA and Europe. Data on the use, efficacy, safety and therapeutic considerations of other pharmacological treatments in children and adolescents with T2D are critically discussed. Although many new and promising therapeutic strategies have been introduced during recent years for the management of T2D in adults, available therapeutic options for the management of pediatric T2D remain limited.",2022,diabetes
27383980,Diet-microbiota interactions as moderators of human metabolism.,"It is widely accepted that obesity and associated metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, are intimately linked to diet. However, the gut microbiota has also become a focus for research at the intersection of diet and metabolic health. Mechanisms that link the gut microbiota with obesity are coming to light through a powerful combination of translation-focused animal models and studies in humans. A body of knowledge is accumulating that points to the gut microbiota as a mediator of dietary impact on the host metabolic status. Efforts are focusing on the establishment of causal relationships in people and the prospect of therapeutic interventions such as personalized nutrition.",2016,diabetes
31960666,Food groups in dietary prevention of type 2 diabetes.,"According to the World Health Organization diabetes will be the seventh leading cause of death worldwide in 2030. Majority of diabetic patients suffer from type 2 diabetes (T2DM), which is mostly avoidable. The most important modifiable risk factors of type 2 diabetes are: overweight and obesity, improper diet, sedentary lifestyle and tobacco smoking. Even in prediabetic state, improving diet and physical activity can slow down or even stop progression to diabetes. In the view of health burden of diabetes it is essential to thoroughly investigate the risk factors and develop more specific preventive strategies. Recently published studies focus on food groups rather than individual products to assess the link between nutrition and risk of type 2 diabetes. Identifying food groups of possible beneficial and deleterious effect on the risk of type 2 diabetes could facilitate the dietary counselling. The aim of the overview is to summarize the possible association between consumption of food groups on the risk of type 2 diabetes on the basis of available literature. Observations from studies and meta-analyses indicate on an inverse association between consumption of fresh vegetables and fruit, whole grains, lean dairy, fish, nuts and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Food groups that seemed to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes are: red and processed meat, refined grains, sugar-sweetened beverages. It is important to note, that no individual nutrients, but diverse dietary pattern, composed of every recommended food group in adequate amounts can contribute to healthy lifestyle and T2DM prevention.",2019,diabetes
38363031,Chrononutrition in type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity: A narrative review.,"Chrononutrition is a nutritional regimen that follows our biological clock, marked by the changes in metabolism that occur during the day. This regimen includes the distribution of energy, the regularity and frequency of meals, and the importance of these factors for metabolic health. A growing body of animal and human evidence indicates that the timing of food intake throughout the day can have a significant and beneficial impact on the metabolic health and well-being of individuals. In particular, both the timing and frequency of meals have been associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, and other chronic conditions. Today's busy lifestyle makes many people skip breakfast and eat late at night. Eating late at night has been shown to cause a circadian misalignment, with the latter having a negative impact on weight control and glucose metabolism. Additionally, some studies have found a relatively strong association between skipping breakfast and insulin resistance, and T2DM. Against the backdrop of escalating obesity and T2DM rates, coupled with the recognized influence of food timing on disease evolution and control, this review aimed to synthesize insights from epidemiological and intervention studies of the interplay of timing of food intake and macronutrient consumption, reporting their impact on obesity and T2DM.",2024,diabetes
37610590,Precision Nutrition to Improve Risk Factors of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.,"Existing dietary and lifestyle interventions and recommendations, to improve the risk factors of obesity and type 2 diabetes with the target to mitigate this double global epidemic, have produced inconsistent results due to interpersonal variabilities in response to these conventional approaches, and inaccuracies in dietary assessment methods. Precision nutrition, an emerging strategy, tailors an individual's key characteristics such as diet, phenotype, genotype, metabolic biomarkers, and gut microbiome for personalized dietary recommendations to optimize dietary response and health. Precision nutrition is suggested to be an alternative and potentially more effective strategy to improve dietary intake and prevention of obesity and chronic diseases. The purpose of this narrative review is to synthesize the current research and examine the state of the science regarding the effect of precision nutrition in improving the risk factors of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The results of the research review indicate to a large extent significant evidence supporting the effectiveness of precision nutrition in improving the risk factors of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Deeper insights and further rigorous research into the diet-phenotype-genotype and interactions of other components of precision nutrition may enable this innovative approach to be adapted in health care and public health to the special needs of individuals. Precision nutrition provides the strategy to make individualized dietary recommendations by integrating genetic, phenotypic, nutritional, lifestyle, medical, social, and other pertinent characteristics about individuals, as a means to address the challenges of generalized dietary recommendations. The evidence presented in this review shows that precision nutrition markedly improves risk factors of obesity and type 2 diabetes, particularly behavior change.",2023,diabetes
31781857,Improving type 2 diabetes mellitus glycaemic control through lifestyle modification implementing diet intervention: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus represents a significant health problem. Many studies have reported that intensive nutritional intervention by itself or in addition to medications is the best method to improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, in clinical practice, dietary education is not implemented as an integral part in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to analyse the scientific evidence concerning the role of nutritional intervention in the glycaemic control of type 2 diabetes mellitus. We searched Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases from inception till May 2019 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that include dietary interventions in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 28 studies were included. Our results demonstrated that lifestyle interventions significantly lowered glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) levels compared to the usual care for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, overall weighted mean difference, WMD = - 0.51 (- 0.67, - 0.35). Strategies combining individualized and group-based activities were the most effective, WMD = - 0.95 (- 1.24, - 0.66). Most of stratified analyses did not totally resolve heterogeneity, but improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels has been consistently observed. The available evidence from RCTs shows that lifestyle intervention is more effective than the standard care regarding the glycaemic control of type 2 diabetic patients, particularly when there is a weight loss. It is time to translate this evidence to the primary health care practice. The protocol of the present systematic review was registered in PROSPERO, registration number CRD42018090469.",2020,diabetes
26260349,A journey into a Mediterranean diet and type 2 diabetes: a systematic review with meta-analyses.,"To summarise the evidence about the efficacy of a Mediterranean diet on the management of type 2 diabetes and prediabetic states. A systematic review of all meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the Mediterranean diet with a control diet on the treatment of type 2 diabetes and prediabetic states was conducted. Electronic searches were carried out up to January 2015. Trials were included for meta-analyses if they had a control group treated with another diet, if they were of sufficient duration (at least 6 months), and if they had at least 30 participants in each arm. A random-effect model was used to pool data. Adults with or at risk for type 2 diabetes. Dietary patterns that described themselves as using a 'Mediterranean' dietary pattern. The outcomes were glycaemic control, cardiovascular risk factors and remission from the metabolic syndrome. From 2824 studies, 8 meta-analyses and 5 RCTs were eligible. A 'de novo' meta-analysis of 3 long-term (>6 months) RCTs of the Mediterranean diet and glycaemic control of diabetes favoured the Mediterranean diet as compared with lower fat diets. Another 'de novo' meta-analysis of two long-term RCTs showed a 49% increased probability of remission from the metabolic syndrome. 5 meta-analyses showed a favourable effect of the Mediterranean diet, as compared with other diets, on body weight, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. 2 meta-analyses demonstrated that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet reduced the risk of future diabetes by 19-23%. The Mediterranean diet was associated with better glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk factors than control diets, including a lower fat diet, suggesting that it is suitable for the overall management of type 2 diabetes.",2015,diabetes
37960324,Regulation of Macronutrients in Insulin Resistance and Glucose Homeostasis during Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Insulin resistance is an important feature of metabolic syndrome and a precursor of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Overnutrition-induced obesity is a major risk factor for the development of insulin resistance and T2DM. The intake of macronutrients plays a key role in maintaining energy balance. The components of macronutrients distinctly regulate insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. Precisely adjusting the beneficial food compound intake is important for the prevention of insulin resistance and T2DM. Here, we reviewed the effects of different components of macronutrients on insulin sensitivity and their underlying mechanisms, including fructose, dietary fiber, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, and amino acids. Understanding the diet-gene interaction will help us to better uncover the molecular mechanisms of T2DM and promote the application of precision nutrition in practice by integrating multi-omics analysis.",2023,diabetes
31036503,Morbidity and mortality after lifestyle intervention for people with impaired glucose tolerance: 30-year results of the Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Outcome Study.,"Lifestyle interventions can delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance, but whether this leads subsequently to fewer complications or to increased longevity is uncertain. We aimed to assess the long-term effects of lifestyle interventions in people with impaired glucose tolerance on the incidence of diabetes, its complications, and mortality. The original study was a cluster randomised trial, started in 1986, in which 33 clinics in Da Qing, China, were randomly assigned to either be a control clinic or provide one of three interventions (diet, exercise, or diet plus exercise) for 6 years for 577 adults with impaired glucose tolerance who usually receive their medical care from the clinics. Subsequently, participants were followed for up to 30 years to assess the effects of intervention on the incidence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease events, composite microvascular complications, cardiovascular disease death, all-cause mortality, and life expectancy. Of the 577 participants, 438 were assigned to an intervention group and 138 to the control group (one refused baseline examination). After 30 years of follow-up, 540 (94%) of 576 participants were assessed for outcomes (135 in the control group, 405 in the intervention group). During the 30-year follow-up, compared with control, the combined intervention group had a median delay in diabetes onset of 3·96 years (95% CI 1·25 to 6·67; p=0·0042), fewer cardiovascular disease events (hazard ratio 0·74, 95% CI 0·59-0·92; p=0·0060), a lower incidence of microvascular complications (0·65, 0·45-0·95; p=0·025), fewer cardiovascular disease deaths (0·67, 0·48-0·94; p=0·022), fewer all-cause deaths (0·74, 0·61-0·89; p=0·0015), and an average increase in life expectancy of 1·44 years (95% CI 0·20-2·68; p=0·023). Lifestyle intervention in people with impaired glucose tolerance delayed the onset of type 2 diabetes and reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events, microvascular complications, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and increased life expectancy. These findings provide strong justification to continue to implement and expand the use of such interventions to curb the global epidemic of type 2 diabetes and its consequences.

34843670,Systematic Review of Lifestyle Interventions for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period.,"To examine the characteristics and effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnancy and the postpartum period to prevent Type 2 diabetes. We conducted searches in seven databases, including Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, Ovid PsycInfo, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses for articles published from inception to January 2021. We included articles on controlled intervention studies in which researchers evaluated a lifestyle intervention provided during pregnancy and the postpartum period for women with or at risk for GDM that were published in English. Twelve articles that were reports of seven studies met the inclusion criteria. In some cases, more than one article was selected from the same study. For example, articles reported different outcomes from the same study. We extracted data with the use of a data collection form and compared and synthesized data on study design, purpose, sample, intervention characteristics, recruitment and retention, and outcomes. All seven studies focused on weight management and/or healthy lifestyle behaviors (diet and physical activity). Outcomes included glucose regulation, weight, lifestyle behaviors, and knowledge. The interventions varied in duration/dosage, strategies, and modes of delivery. In four studies, researchers reported interventions that had significant effects on improving glucose regulation and/or weight change. Some characteristics from the four effective interventions included goal setting, individualized care, and good retention rates. In the other three studies, limitations included low rates of participant retention, lack of personalized interventions, and limited population diversity or lack of culturally sensitive care. Lifestyle interventions provided during and after pregnancy to reduce the risk associated with GDM have the potential to improve outcomes. Health care counseling to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors related to the prevention of Type 2 diabetes is needed at different stages of maternity care for women with GDM. Additional high-quality studies are needed to address the limitations of current studies.",2022,diabetes
39026309,Lifestyle factors and their relative contributions to longitudinal progression of cardio-renal-metabolic multimorbidity: a prospective cohort study.,"The role of lifestyle factors and their relative contributions to the development and mortality of cardio-renal-metabolic multimorbidity (CRMM) remains unclear. A study was conducted with 357,554 UK Biobank participants. CRMM was defined as the coexistence of two or three cardio-renal-metabolic diseases (CRMDs), including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The prospective study examined the associations of individual and combined lifestyle scores (diet, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep duration and social connection) with longitudinal progression from healthy to first cardio-renal-metabolic disease (FCRMD), then to CRMM, and ultimately to death, using a multistate model. Subsequently, quantile G-computation was employed to assess the relative contribution of each lifestyle factor. During a median follow-up of 13.62 years, lifestyle played crucial role in all transitions from healthy to FCRMD, then to CRMM, and ultimately to death. The hazard ratios (95% CIs) per score increase were 0.91 (0.90, 0.91) and 0.90 (0.89, 0.91) for healthy to FCRMD, and for FCRMD to CRMM, and 0.84 (0.83, 0.86), 0.87 (0.86, 0.89), and 0.90 (0.88, 0.93) for mortality risk from healthy, FCRMD, and CRMM, respectively. Among the seven factors, smoking status contributed to high proportions for the whole disease progression, accounting for 19.88-38.10%. High-risk diet contributed the largest proportion to the risk of transition from FCRMD to CRMM, with 22.53%. Less-frequent social connection contributed the largest proportion to the risk of transition from FCRMD to death, with 28.81%. When we further consider the disease-specific transitions, we find that lifestyle scores had slightly stronger associations with development to T2D than to CVD or CKD. Our study indicates that a healthy lifestyle may have a protective effect throughout the longitudinal progression of CRMM, informing more effective management and treatment. Smoking status, diet, and social connection played pivotal roles in specific disease transitions.",2024,diabetes

To evaluate the role of modifiable lifestyle behaviors in the association between chronotype and diabetes risk. Prospective cohort study. Nurses' Health Study II. 63 676 nurses aged 45 to 62 years with no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes in 2009 were prospectively followed until 2017. Self-reported chronotype using a validated question from the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. The lifestyle behaviors that were measured were diet quality, physical activity, alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and sleep duration. Incident diabetes cases were self-reported and confirmed using a supplementary questionnaire. Participants reporting a ""definite evening"" chronotype were 54% (95% CI, 49% to 59%) more likely to have an unhealthy lifestyle than participants reporting a ""definite morning"" chronotype. A total of 1925 diabetes cases were documented over 469 120 person-years of follow-up. Compared with the ""definite morning"" chronotype, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for diabetes was 1.21 (CI, 1.09 to 1.35) for the ""intermediate"" chronotype and 1.72 (CI, 1.50 to 1.98) for the ""definite evening"" chronotype after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, shift work, and family history of diabetes. Further adjustment for BMI, physical activity, and diet quality attenuated the association comparing the ""definite evening"" and ""definite morning"" chronotypes to 1.31 (CI, 1.13 to 1.50), 1.54 (CI, 1.34 to 1.77), and 1.59 (CI, 1.38 to 1.83), respectively. Accounting for all measured lifestyle and sociodemographic factors resulted in a reduced but still positive association (HR comparing ""definite evening"" vs. ""definite morning"" chronotype, 1.19 [CI, 1.03 to 1.37]). Chronotype assessment using a single question, self-reported data, and homogeneity of the study population. Middle-aged nurses with an evening chronotype were more likely to report unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and had increased diabetes risk compared with those with a morning chronotype.

37794451,Association between a mediterranean lifestyle and Type 2 diabetes incidence: a prospective UK biobank study.,"There is mounting evidence that the Mediterranean diet prevents type 2 diabetes, but little is known about the role of Mediterranean lifestyles other than diet and among non-Mediterranean populations. This work aimed to examine the association between a comprehensive Mediterranean-type lifestyle and type 2 diabetes incidence in a British adult population. We used data from 112,493 individuals free of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, aged 40-69 years, from the UK Biobank cohort, who were followed from 2009 to 2010 to 2021. The Mediterranean lifestyle was assessed through the 25-item MEDLIFE index, which comprises three blocks: (a) ""Mediterranean food consumption"", (b) ""Mediterranean dietary habits"", (c) ""Physical activity, rest, social habits, and conviviality"". Diabetes incidence was obtained from clinical records. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to analyze associations and adjusted for the main potential confounders. After a median follow-up of 9.4 years, 2,724 cases of type 2 diabetes were ascertained. Compared to the first quartile of MEDLIFE adherence, the hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for increasing quartiles of adherence were 0.90 (0.82-0.99), 0.80 (0.72-0.89) and 0.70 (0.62-0.79) (p-trend < 0.001). All three blocks of MEDLIFE were independently associated with lower risk of diabetes. Higher adherence to the MEDLIFE index was associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank.

We randomised (parallel-arm; computerised 1:1 randomisation ratio) 169 adults aged 18-75 years with type 2 diabetes in the Marshall Islands to an intensive whole-food, plant-based intervention with moderate exercise (PB+Ex) or SMC for 24 weeks. The PB+Ex intervention included 12 weeks of meals, exercise sessions and group classes. Primary outcomes were glycaemic control (HbA<sub>1c</sub>, glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR) and glucose-lowering medication use. Secondary outcomes included lipids, blood pressure, heart rate and C-reactive protein. Only lab analysts were blinded. Compared with SMC (n=90 randomised; n=70 analysed), the PB+Ex (n=79 randomised; n=66 analysed) intervention decreased HbA<sub>1c</sub> by an additional 14 mmol/mol (1.3%) at week 12 (-22 vs -7 mmol/mol [-2.0% vs -0.7%]; p<0.0001) and 8 mmol/mol (0.7%) at week 24 (-16 vs -8 mmol/mol [-1.4% vs -0.7%]; p=0.01). Concomitantly, 63% of medicated PB+Ex participants reduced their glucose-lowering medications (vs 24%; p=0.006), and 23% of PB+Ex participants with a baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> <75 mmol/mol (<9%) achieved remission. Additionally, the PB+Ex intervention reduced weight (-2.7 kg; p<0.0001), C-reactive protein (-11 nmol/l; p=0.005) and cardiovascular medication use compared with SMC. At intermediate timepoints, it improved glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, cholesterol, triglycerides and heart rate, but not at week 24. A whole-food, plant-based lifestyle intervention was more effective for improving glycaemic control than SMC. It also reduced the need for diabetes and cardiovascular medications and induced diabetes remission in some participants. Therefore, it is an effective, evidence-based lifestyle option for individuals with type 2 diabetes.

31482198,Combined lifestyle factors and risk of incident type 2 diabetes and prognosis among individuals with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.,"A healthy lifestyle has been widely recommended for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. However, no systematic review has summarised the relationship between combined lifestyle factors (including, but not limited to, smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity, diet and being overweight or obese) and incident type 2 diabetes and risk of health outcomes among diabetic individuals. EMBASE and PubMed were searched up to April 2019 without language restrictions. References included in articles in relevant publications were also screened. Cohort studies investigating the combined associations of at least three lifestyle factors with incident type 2 diabetes and health outcomes among diabetic individuals were included. Reviewers were paired and independently screened studies, extracted data and evaluated study quality. Random-effects models were used to calculate summary HRs. Heterogeneity and publication bias tests were also conducted. Compared with participants considered to have the least-healthy lifestyle, those with the healthiest lifestyle had a 75% lower risk of incident diabetes (HR 0.25 [95% CI 0.18, 0.35]; 14 studies with approximately 1 million participants). The associations were largely consistent and significant among individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds and baseline characteristics. Among individuals with type 2 diabetes (10 studies with 34,385 participants), the HRs (95% CIs) were 0.44 (0.33, 0.60) for all-cause death, 0.51 (0.30, 0.86) for cardiovascular death, 0.69 (0.47, 1.00) for cancer death and 0.48 (0.37, 0.63) for incident cardiovascular disease when comparing the healthiest lifestyle with the least-healthy lifestyle. Adoption of a healthy lifestyle is associated with substantial risk reduction in type 2 diabetes and long-term adverse outcomes among diabetic individuals. Tackling multiple risk factors, instead of concentrating on one certain lifestyle factor, should be the cornerstone for reducing the global burden of type 2 diabetes.",2020,diabetes
40200054,Microbiome-metabolome dynamics associated with impaired glucose control and responses to lifestyle changes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease shaped by genetic and environmental factors, including the gut microbiome. Recent research revealed pathophysiological heterogeneity and distinct subgroups in both T2D and prediabetes, prompting exploration of personalized risk factors. Using metabolomics in two Swedish cohorts (n = 1,167), we identified over 500 blood metabolites associated with impaired glucose control, with approximately one-third linked to an altered gut microbiome. Our findings identified metabolic disruptions in microbiome-metabolome dynamics as potential mediators of compromised glucose homeostasis, as illustrated by the potential interactions between Hominifimenecus microfluidus and Blautia wexlerae via hippurate. Short-term lifestyle changes, for example, diet and exercise, modulated microbiome-associated metabolites in a lifestyle-specific manner. This study suggests that the microbiome-metabolome axis is a modifiable target for T2D management, with optimal health benefits achievable through a combination of lifestyle modifications.",2025,diabetes
31665015,The management of very low-calorie ketogenic diet in obesity outpatient clinic: a practical guide.,"The epidemic of obesity is growing steadily across the whole world. Obesity is not only a merely aesthetic disease but is the ""mother"" of most chronic diseases such as associated with a range of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. However, although there is a need to find a strategy to stop this epidemic disease, most of the times the current nutritional strategies are not effective in weight loss and in long term weight maintenance. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is increasingly establishing as a successful nutritional pattern to manage obesity; this is due to rapid weight loss that gives rise to a positive psychological cycle which in turn increases the compliance to diet. Another important key point of VLCKD is the ability to preserve fatty free mass which is known to play a role of paramount importance in glucose metabolism. Despite the clinical evidence of VLCKD there are paucity of data regarding to its management. Therefore, we will provide a useful guide to be used by nutrition experts taking care of subjects with obesity. In particular, we will report recommendations on the correct use of this therapeutic approach for weight loss and management of side effects.",2019,diabetes
36515429,Effect of an Intermittent Calorie-restricted Diet on Type 2 Diabetes Remission: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"The 2021 consensus report on the definition and interpretation of remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been released. Although intermittent fasting diets (IF) are becoming very popular, no studies have investigated their benefit in diabetes remission. The present study examined the effectiveness of IF in diabetes remission and potential remission durability. Participants between ages 38 and 72 years with a duration of T2D of 1 to 11 years, a body mass index (BMI) of 19.1 to 30.4, 66.7% male, and antidiabetic agent use and/or insulin injection were randomly allocated at a ratio of 1:1 to the Chinese Medical Nutrition Therapy (CMNT) or control group. The primary outcome was diabetes remission, defined as a stable glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of less than 48 mmol/mol (< 6.5%) for at least 3 months after discontinuing all antidiabetic medications. The secondary outcomes included HbA1c level, fasting blood glucose level, blood pressure, weight, quality of life, and medication costs. We conducted a 12-month follow-up to assess the continuation of remission. On completing the 3-month intervention plus 3-month follow-up, 47.2% (17/36) of participants achieved diabetes remission in the CMNT group, whereas only 2.8% (1/36) of individuals achieved remission in the control group (odds ratio 31.32; 95% CI, 2.39-121.07; P < 0.0001). The mean body weight of participants in the CMNT group was reduced by 5.93 kg (SD 2.47) compared to 0.27 kg (1.43) in the control group. After the 12-month follow-up, 44.4% (16/36) of the participants achieved sustained remission, with an HbA1c level of 6.33% (SD 0.87). The medication costs of the CMNT group were 77.22% lower than those of the control group (60.4/month vs 265.1/month).

25935570,Lifestyle weight-loss intervention outcomes in overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.,"The majority of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese, and weight loss is a recommended treatment strategy. A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to answer the following primary question: In overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes, what are the outcomes on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from lifestyle weight-loss interventions resulting in weight losses greater than or less than 5% at 12 months? Secondary questions are: What are the lipid (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) outcomes from lifestyle weight-loss interventions resulting in weight losses greater than or less than 5% at 12 months? And, what are the weight and metabolic outcomes from differing amounts of macronutrients in weight-loss interventions? Inclusion criteria included randomized clinical trial implementing weight-loss interventions in overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes, minimum 12-month study duration, a 70% completion rate, and an HbA1c value reported at 12 months. Eleven trials (eight compared two weight-loss interventions and three compared a weight-loss intervention group with a usual care/control group) with 6,754 participants met study criteria. At 12 months, 17 study groups (8 categories of weight-loss intervention) reported weight loss <5% of initial weight (-3.2 kg [95% CI: -5.9, -0.6]). A meta-analysis of the weight-loss interventions reported nonsignificant beneficial effects on HbA1c, lipids, or blood pressure. Two study groups reported a weight loss of ≥5%: a Mediterranean-style diet implemented in newly diagnosed adults with type 2 diabetes and an intensive lifestyle intervention implemented in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial. Both included regular physical activity and frequent contact with health professionals and reported significant beneficial effects on HbA1c, lipids, and blood pressure. Five trials (10 study groups) compared weight-loss interventions of differing amounts of macronutrients and reported nonsignificant differences in weight loss, HbA1c, lipids, and blood pressure. The majority of lifestyle weight-loss interventions in overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes resulted in weight loss <5% and did not result in beneficial metabolic outcomes. A weight loss of >5% appears necessary for beneficial effects on HbA1c, lipids, and blood pressure. Achieving this level of weight loss requires intense interventions, including energy restriction, regular physical activity, and frequent contact with health professionals. Weight loss for many overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes might not be a realistic primary treatment strategy for improved glycemic control. Nutrition therapy for individuals with type 2 diabetes should encourage a healthful eating pattern, a reduced energy intake, regular physical activity, education, and support as primary treatment strategies.",2015,diabetes
36701156,Adherence to a Healthy Lifestyle in Association With Microvascular Complications Among Adults With Type 2 Diabetes.,"The association between an overall healthy lifestyle and the subsequent risk of microvascular complications among patients with diabetes remains unclear. To examine the association between adherence to a healthy lifestyle before and after diabetes diagnosis and the risk of subsequent microvascular complications among adults with diabetes. This prospective cohort study included incident patients with type 2 diabetes who were free of cardiovascular disease and cancer at the time of diabetes diagnosis and completed the diabetes supplementary questionnaires in the Nurses' Health Study (in 2000 and 2005) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (in 2000, 2004, and 2008) in the US. Data were analyzed from April to August 2021. Diet and lifestyle factors before and after diabetes diagnosis were assessed by validated questionnaires. A healthy lifestyle consisted of nonsmoking, having a healthy body weight (a body mass index of ≥18.5 or <25), engaging in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (≥150 minutes per week), consuming a high-quality diet (top 40th percentile of the Alternative Healthy Eating Index), and moderate alcohol drinking (5-15 g/d for women and 5-30 g/d for men). Physician-diagnosed microvascular complications including diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and foot disorders were self-reported at questionnaire surveys. A total of 7077 patients with type 2 diabetes were included in the cohort (4982 women in NHS and 2095 men in HPFS, mean [SD] age 61 [8.8], 94.2% White). During follow-up, 2878 patients developed microvascular complications. After multivariable adjustment, adherence to a healthy lifestyle before and after diabetes diagnosis were both associated with a lower risk of developing microvascular complications. The relative risk (RR) for participants with 4 or more low-risk lifestyle factors before diabetes diagnosis compared with zero was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.60-0.91) for any microvascular complications, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.54-0.93) for diabetic neuropathy, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.57-1.01) for diabetic retinopathy, 0.42 (95% CI, 0.23-0.79) for diabetic nephropathy, and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.35-1.00) for diabetic foot disorders. Similar results were observed for adherence to a healthy lifestyle after diabetes diagnosis, with an RR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.55-0.83) for any microvascular complications, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.51-0.88) for diabetic neuropathy, 0.65 (95% CI, 0.48-0.86) for diabetic retinopathy, 0.57 (95% CI, 0.34-0.98) for diabetic nephropathy, and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.37-1.05) for diabetic foot disorders. In addition, greater improvement in lifestyle factors from before to after diabetes diagnosis was also significantly associated with a lower risk of neuropathy or total microvascular complications. Each increment in number of low-risk lifestyle factors was associated with a 6% (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.98) lower risk for any microvascular complications and a 9% (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.96) lower risk for diabetic neuropathy. Consistent results were observed when analyses were stratified by age at diabetes diagnosis, sex/cohort, or lifestyle factors before diabetes diagnosis. In this cohort study, adhering to an overall healthy lifestyle was associated with a significantly lower risk of microvascular complications among individuals with diabetes. These findings suggest substantial reduction in the burden of microvascular complications associated with adopting a healthy lifestyle among patients with type 2 diabetes.",2023,diabetes
39060542,Artificial intelligence chatbots for the nutrition management of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.,"Recently, there has been a growing interest in exploring AI-driven chatbots, such as ChatGPT, as a resource for disease management and education. The study aims to evaluate ChatGPT's accuracy and quality/clarity in providing nutritional management for Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM), the Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, in accordance with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' guidelines. Three nutrition management-related domains were considered: (1) Dietary management, (2) Nutrition care process (NCP) and (3) Menu planning (1500 kcal). A total of 63 prompts were used. Two experienced dietitians evaluated the chatbot output's concordance with the guidelines. Both dietitians provided similar assessments for most conditions examined in the study. Gaps in the ChatGPT-derived outputs were identified and included weight loss recommendations, energy deficit, anthropometric assessment, specific nutrients of concern and the adoption of specific dietary interventions. Gaps in physical activity recommendations were also observed, highlighting ChatGPT's limitations in providing holistic lifestyle interventions. Within the NCP, the generated output provided incomplete examples of diagnostic documentation statements and had significant gaps in the monitoring and evaluation step. In the 1500 kcal one-day menus, the amounts of carbohydrates, fat, vitamin D and calcium were discordant with dietary recommendations. Regarding clarity, dietitians rated the output as either good or excellent.

35859134,"Associations of polysocial risk score, lifestyle and genetic factors with incident type 2 diabetes: a prospective cohort study.","We aimed to investigate the association between polysocial risk score (PsRS), an estimator of individual-level exposure to cumulative social risks, and incident type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank study. This study includes 319,832 participants who were free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline in the UK Biobank study. The PsRS was calculated by counting the 12 social determinants of health from three social risk domains (namely socioeconomic status, psychosocial factors, and neighbourhood and living environment) that had a statistically significant association with incident type 2 diabetes after Bonferroni correction. A healthy lifestyle score was calculated using information on smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, diet quality and sleep quality. A genetic risk score was calculated using 403 SNPs that showed significant genome-wide associations with type 2 diabetes in people of European descent. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyse the association between the PsRS and incident type 2 diabetes. During a median follow-up period of 8.7 years, 4427 participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. After adjustment for major confounders, an intermediate PsRS (4-6) and high PsRS (≥7) was associated with higher risks of developing type 2 diabetes with the HRs being 1.38 (95% CI 1.26, 1.52) and 2.02 (95% CI 1.83, 2.22), respectively, compared with those with a low PsRS (≤3). In addition, an intermediate to high PsRS accounted for approximately 34% (95% CI 29, 39) of new-onset type 2 diabetes cases. A healthy lifestyle slightly, but significantly, mitigated PsRS-related risks of type 2 diabetes (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.030). In addition, the additive interactions between PsRS and genetic predisposition led to 15% (95% CI 13, 17; p<0.001) of new-onset type 2 diabetes cases (p<sub>interaction</sub><0.001). A higher PsRS was related to increased risks of type 2 diabetes. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle may attenuate elevated diabetes risks due to social vulnerability. Genetic susceptibility and disadvantaged social status may act synergistically, resulting in additional risks for type 2 diabetes.",2022,diabetes
37943581,An AI Dietitian for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Management Based on Large Language and Image Recognition Models: Preclinical Concept Validation Study.,"Nutritional management for patients with diabetes in China is a significant challenge due to the low supply of registered clinical dietitians. To address this, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based nutritionist program that uses advanced language and image recognition models was created. This program can identify ingredients from images of a patient's meal and offer nutritional guidance and dietary recommendations. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the competence of the models that support this program. The potential of an AI nutritionist program for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was evaluated through a multistep process. First, a survey was conducted among patients with T2DM and endocrinologists to identify knowledge gaps in dietary practices. ChatGPT and GPT 4.0 were then tested through the Chinese Registered Dietitian Examination to assess their proficiency in providing evidence-based dietary advice. ChatGPT's responses to common questions about medical nutrition therapy were compared with expert responses by professional dietitians to evaluate its proficiency. The model's food recommendations were scrutinized for consistency with expert advice. A deep learning-based image recognition model was developed for food identification at the ingredient level, and its performance was compared with existing models. Finally, a user-friendly app was developed, integrating the capabilities of language and image recognition models to potentially improve care for patients with T2DM. Most patients (182/206, 88.4%) demanded more immediate and comprehensive nutritional management and education. Both ChatGPT and GPT 4.0 passed the Chinese Registered Dietitian examination. ChatGPT's food recommendations were mainly in line with best practices, except for certain foods like root vegetables and dry beans. Professional dietitians' reviews of ChatGPT's responses to common questions were largely positive, with 162 out of 168 providing favorable reviews. The multilabel image recognition model evaluation showed that the Dino V2 model achieved an average F<sub>1</sub> score of 0.825, indicating high accuracy in recognizing ingredients. The model evaluations were promising. The AI-based nutritionist program is now ready for a supervised pilot study.",2023,diabetes
38201924,Comparative Evaluation of a Low-Carbohydrate Diet and a Mediterranean Diet in Overweight/Obese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A 16-Week Intervention Study.,"The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity has been steadily increasing over the past four decades, with projections indicating a significant rise in the number of affected individuals by 2045. Therapeutic interventions in T2DM aim to control blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of complications. Dietary and lifestyle modifications play a crucial role in the management of T2DM and obesity. While conventional medical nutritional therapy (MNT) often promotes a high-carbohydrate, low-fat Mediterranean diet as an elective treatment, low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs), specifically those restricting carbohydrate intake to less than 130 g/day, have gained popularity due to their multifaceted benefits. Scientific research supports the efficacy of LCDs in improving glycemic control, weight loss, blood pressure, lipid profiles, and overall quality of life. However, sustaining these benefits over the long term remains challenging. This trial aimed to compare the effects of a Mediterranean diet vs. a low-carbohydrate diet (carbohydrate intake < 130 g/day) on overweight/obese patients with T2DM over a 16-week period. The study will evaluate the differential effects of these diets on glycemic regulation, weight reduction, lipid profile, and cardiovascular risk factors. The study population comprises 100 overweight/obese patients with poorly controlled T2DM. Anthropometric measurements, bioimpedance analysis, and blood chemistry assessments will be conducted at baseline and after the 16-week intervention period. Both dietary interventions were hypocaloric, with a focus on maintaining a 500 kcal/day energy deficit. After 16 weeks, both diets had positive effects on various parameters, including weight loss, blood pressure, glucose control, lipid profile, and renal function. However, the low-carbohydrate diet appears to result in a greater reduction in BMI, blood pressure, waist circumference, glucose levels, lipid profiles, cardiovascular risk, renal markers, and overall metabolic parameters compared to the Mediterranean diet at the 16-week follow up. These findings suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet may be more effective than a Mediterranean diet in promoting weight loss and improving various metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight/obese patients with T2DM. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to understand the clinical implications and long-term sustainability of these findings.",2023,diabetes
36026526,The human gut microbiota and glucose metabolism: a scoping review of key bacteria and the potential role of SCFAs.,"The gut microbiota plays a fundamental role in human nutrition and metabolism and may have direct implications for type 2 diabetes and associated preconditions. An improved understanding of relations between human gut microbiota and glucose metabolism could lead to novel opportunities for type 2 diabetes prevention, but human observational studies reporting on such findings have not been extensively reviewed. Here, we review the literature on associations between gut microbiota and markers and stages of glucose dysregulation and insulin resistance in healthy adults and in adults with metabolic disease and risk factors. We present the current evidence for identified key bacteria and their potential roles in glucose metabolism independent of overweight, obesity, and metabolic drugs. We provide support for SCFAs mediating such effects and discuss the role of diet, as well as metabolites derived from diet and gut microbiota interactions. From 5983 initially identified PubMed records, 45 original studies were eligible and reviewed. α Diversity and 45 bacterial taxa were associated with selected outcomes. Six taxa were most frequently associated with glucose metabolism: Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium longum, Clostridium leptum group, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Faecalibacterium (inversely associated) and Dorea (directly associated). For Dorea and A. muciniphila, associations were independent of metabolic drugs and body measures. For A. muciniphila and F. prausnitzii, limited evidence supported SCFA mediation of potential effects on glucose metabolism. We conclude that observational studies applying metagenomics sequencing to identify species-level relations are warranted, as are studies accounting for confounding factors and investigating SCFA and postprandial glucose metabolism. Such advances in the field will, together with mechanistic and prospective studies and investigations into diet-gut microbiota interactions, have the potential to bring critical insight into roles of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in human glucose metabolism and to contribute toward the development of novel prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes, including precision nutrition.",2022,diabetes

We aimed to investigate the associations of an overall healthy lifestyle including a healthy sleep pattern with subsequent development of T2DM among participants with hypertension compared to normotension, and to estimate how much of that risk could be prevented. This study examined six lifestyle factors with T2DM cases among hypertension (227,966) and normotension (203,005) and their interaction in the UK Biobank. Low-risk lifestyle factors were defined as standard body mass index (BMI), drinking alcohol in moderation, nonsmoking, engaging in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, eating a high-quality diet, and maintaining a healthy sleep pattern. There were 12,403 incident T2DM cases during an average of 8.63 years of follow-up. Compared to those with 0 low-risk lifestyle factors, HRs for those with 5-6 were 0.14 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.19) for hypertensive participants, 0.13 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.19) for normotensive participants, respectively (p<sub>trend</sub> < 0.001). 76.93% of hypertensive participants were considerably less likely to develop T2DM if they adhered to five healthy lifestyle practices, increased to 81.14% if they followed 6-factors (with a healthy sleep pattern).

37104291,A nutritional biomarker score of the Mediterranean diet and incident type 2 diabetes: Integrated analysis of data from the MedLey randomised controlled trial and the EPIC-InterAct case-cohort study.,"Self-reported adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been modestly inversely associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in cohort studies. There is uncertainty about the validity and magnitude of this association due to subjective reporting of diet. The association has not been evaluated using an objectively measured biomarker of the Mediterranean diet. We derived a biomarker score based on 5 circulating carotenoids and 24 fatty acids that discriminated between the Mediterranean or habitual diet arms of a parallel design, 6-month partial-feeding randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted between 2013 and 2014, the MedLey trial (128 participants out of 166 randomised). We applied this biomarker score in an observational study, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct case-cohort study, to assess the association of the score with T2D incidence over an average of 9.7 years of follow-up since the baseline (1991 to 1998). We included 22,202 participants, of whom 9,453 were T2D cases, with relevant biomarkers from an original case-cohort of 27,779 participants sampled from a cohort of 340,234 people. As a secondary measure of the Mediterranean diet, we used a score estimated from dietary-self report. Within the trial, the biomarker score discriminated well between the 2 arms; the cross-validated C-statistic was 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.94). The score was inversely associated with incident T2D in EPIC-InterAct: the hazard ratio (HR) per standard deviation of the score was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.77) following adjustment for sociodemographic, lifestyle and medical factors, and adiposity. In comparison, the HR per standard deviation of the self-reported Mediterranean diet was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86 to 0.95). Assuming the score was causally associated with T2D, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet in Western European adults by 10 percentiles of the score was estimated to reduce the incidence of T2D by 11% (95% CI: 7% to 14%). The study limitations included potential measurement error in nutritional biomarkers, unclear specificity of the biomarker score to the Mediterranean diet, and possible residual confounding. These findings suggest that objectively assessed adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower risk of T2D and that even modestly higher adherence may have the potential to reduce the population burden of T2D meaningfully.

40817355,Medical nutrition therapy for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major global health concern. Medical nutrition therapy has a key role in T2DM management, with dietary interventions being central to improving glycaemic control and overall metabolic health. Growing evidence suggests that certain dietary strategies can exert direct metabolic benefits independent of weight reduction. The Mediterranean diet has consistently demonstrated metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, along with improved glycaemic control, even in the absence of substantial weight reduction. Low-energy and very-low-energy diets, characterized by moderate to severe caloric restriction, respectively, have also been associated with improvements in cardiometabolic markers and glycaemic regulation. Ketogenic diets promote nutritional ketosis and have shown benefits on glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity and other metabolic outcomes, often preceding substantial weight loss. Intermittent fasting strategies, such as alternate-day fasting or the 5:2 model, and time-restricted eating, have likewise been linked to enhanced glycaemic control and favourable metabolic and cardiovascular effects, although their long-term efficacy and safety require further investigation. This Review aims to provide an evidence-based synthesis of the main nutritional strategies used in the treatment of T2DM, with a focus on their underlying mechanisms, clinical efficacy and potential for sustainable long-term implementation.",2025,diabetes
33066239,Motivation and Barriers to Maintaining Lifestyle Changes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes after an Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (The U-TURN Trial): A Longitudinal Qualitative Study.,"The purpose of this study was to explore and identify factors that influence motivation for and barriers to adopting and maintaining lifestyle changes in patients with type 2 diabetes, following participation in an intensive multiple-lifestyle intervention. Participants were recruited from the U-TURN trial, a one-year, intensive lifestyle intervention for type 2 diabetes patients. This study was conducted over time; informants were interviewed twice after the trial ended with a six-month interval between interviews. The qualitative data from these individual interviews were analysed using systematic text condensation with an inductive approach. Five themes emerged: Social support and relatedness, Achievement of results, Support from healthcare professionals, Identification with and acceptance of the new lifestyle and Coping with ongoing challenges. These are all important for maintaining lifestyle changes and diabetes self-management. Changing one's lifestyle can be a constant, difficult struggle. For sustainable progress after an intensive intervention, the changes must be adopted and endorsed by patients and co-opted into their social setting. Belonging to an exercise group, confidence in managing the lifestyle adjustments and handling of challenges through continual support and professional diabetes treatment are crucial in maintaining and adhering to the new lifestyle.",2020,diabetes

38189639,Resistant starch and type 2 diabetes mellitus: Clinical perspective.,"The immediate and well-documented benefits of carbohydrate restriction include improved glycemic control in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Starch, a significant source of carbohydrates, is categorized as rapidly digestible, slowly digestible, or resistant starch (RS). RS, which is a non-viscous fermentable fiber, has shown promise in animal studies for antidiabetic effects by improving glucose metabolism. Although the exact mechanism by which RS affects glucose metabolism remains unclear, it is expected to positively impact glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The fermentation of RS by colonic microbiota in the large bowel produces short-chain fatty acids, which exert multiple metabolic effects on glucose regulation and homeostasis. Moreover, RS may influence glucose metabolism via bile acid modulation, independent of its fermentation. Diets rich in RS could aid in blood glucose homeostasis. However, it is uncertain whether they can alter the metabolic pathology associated with glucose regulation. In essence, RS has the potential to lower postprandial glucose levels similarly to a low-glycemic index diet. Yet, its efficacy as a medical nutrition therapy for type 2 diabetes needs further investigation. To confirm the role of RS in glycemic control and to possibly recommend it as an additional dietary approach for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a well-designed, large-scale intervention is required.",2024,diabetes
31250127,Epigenetics and Type 2 Diabetes Risk.,"The influence of environmental factors on type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk is now well recognized and highlights the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms. This review will focus on the role of epigenetic factors in the risk and pathogenesis of T2D. Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as a key mechanism underpinning the pathogenesis of T2D and its complications. Environmental variations, including alterations in lifestyle, nutrition, and metabolic demands during prenatal and postnatal life can induce epigenetic changes that may impact glucose homeostasis and the function of different metabolic organs. Accumulating data continues to uncover the specific pathways that are epigenetically dysregulated in T2D, providing an opportunity for therapeutic targeting. Environmental changes can disrupt specific epigenetic mechanisms underlying metabolic homeostasis, thus contributing to T2D pathogenesis. Such epigenetic changes can be transmitted to the next generation, contributing to the inheritance of T2D risk. Recent advances in epigenome-wide association studies and epigenetic editing tools present the attractive possibility of identifying epimutations associated with T2D, correcting specific epigenetic alterations, and designing novel epigenetic biomarkers and interventions for T2D.",2019,diabetes

In a parallel groups design, 51 adults (35-65 y) with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and overweight/obesity (HbA1c ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol), BMI ≥25-≤40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) commenced a six-month intervention. Following baseline, participants were randomised to TRE (1000-1900 h) or DIET (individualised dietetic guidance) with four consultations over four months. Changes in HbA1c (primary), body composition, and self-reported adherence (secondary) were analysed using linear mixed models. A non-inferiority margin of 0.3% (4 mmol/mol) HbA1c was set a priori. Forty-three participants (56 ± 8 y, BMI: 33 ± 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, HbA1c: 7.6 ± 0.8%) completed the intervention. HbA1c was reduced (P=0.002; TRE: -0.4% (-5 mmol/mol), DIET: -0.3% (-4 mmol/mol)) with no group or interaction effects; TRE was non-inferior to DIET (-0.11%, 95%CI: -0.50% to 0.28%). Body mass reduced in both groups (TRE: -1.7 kg; DIET: -1.2 kg) via ∼900 kJ/d spontaneous energy reduction (P<0.001). Self-reported adherence was higher in TRE versus DIET (P<0.001). When individualised dietary guidance is not available, effective, and/or suitable, TRE may be an alternative dietary strategy to improve glycaemic control in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.",2024,diabetes

Compelling evidence from epidemiological studies has highlighted that an unhealthy lifestyle, such as obesity, physical inactivity and poor diet are significant drivers of the epidemic of T2D. Meanwhile, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of T2D and glycemic traits loci. Emerging data emphasize the critical role that gene-environment interactions have played in the development of T2D. Identifying the genetic, environmental factors and their complex interplays may help elucidate the biological pathways of T2D, identify the high-risk groups and characterize heterogeneity in intervention programs.

39449123,Metabolic and lifestyle factors accelerate disease onset and alter gut microbiome in inflammatory non-communicable diseases.,"Biomedical and lifestyle factors in Western populations have significantly shifted in recent decades, influencing public health and contributing to the increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) that share inflammation as common pathology. We investigated the relationship between these factors and 11 NCDs in the cross-sectional FoCus cohort (n = 1220), using logistic regression models. Associations with age-at-disease-onset were specifically analyzed for type 2 diabetes (T2D, low-grade chronic inflammation) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, high-grade chronic inflammation) in disease-specific cohorts (FoCus-T2D, n = 514; IBD-KC, n = 1110). Important factors for disease risk were identified using Cox-PH-regression models and time-to-event analysis. We further explored the interaction between identified risk factors and gut microbiome composition using linear models. Lifestyle factors were clearly linked to disease phenotypes, particularly in T2D and IBD. Still, some factors affected only the age-at-onset, but not disease prevalence. High-quality nutrition significantly delayed onset for both IBD and T2D (IBD: HR = 0.81 [0.66; 0.98]; T2D: HR = 0.45 [0.28; 0.72]). Smoking accelerated T2D onset (HR = 1.82 [1.25; 2.65]) but delayed onset in ulcerative colitis (UC: HR = 0.47 [0.28; 0.79]). Higher microbiota diversity delayed IBD onset (Shannon: HR = 0.58 [0.49; 0.71]) but had no effect on T2D. The abundance of specific microbial genera was strongly associated with various biomedical and lifestyle factors in T2D and IBD. In unaffected controls, these effects were smaller or reversed, potentially indicating a greater susceptibility of the gut microbiome to negative influences in T2D and IBD. The dual insights into age-at-disease-onset and gut microbiota composition in disease emphasize the role of certain biomedical and lifestyle factors, e.g., nutrition quality, in disease prevention and management. Understanding these relationships provides a foundation for developing targeted strategies to mitigate the impact of metabolic and inflammatory diseases through lifestyle modifications and gut health management.",2024,diabetes

We included 287 men from the Men's Lifestyle Validation Study, a substudy of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS), who provided up to two pairs of faecal samples and two blood samples. Diet was assessed using 7-day diet records. Associations between plasma concentrations of tryptophan metabolites and T2D CHD risk were examined in 13 032 participants from Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHSII and HPFS. We identified 17 microbial species whose abundance was significantly associated with plasma IPA concentrations. A significant association between higher tryptophan intake and higher IPA concentrations was only observed among men who had higher fibre intake and a higher microbial species score consisting of the 17 species (p-interaction<0.01). Dietary and plasma concentrations of tryptophan and most kynurenine pathway metabolites were positively associated with T2D risk (HR<sub>Q5 vs Q1</sub> ranged from 1.17 to 1.46) while a significant inverse association was found for IPA (HR<sub>Q5 vs Q1</sub> (95% CI) 0.70 (0.56 to 0.88)). No associations were found in CHD for any plasma tryptophan metabolites. Specific microbial species and dietary fibre jointly predicted significantly higher circulating IPA concentrations at higher tryptophan intake. Dietary and plasma tryptophan, as well as its kynurenine pathway metabolites, demonstrated divergent associations from those for IPA, which was significantly predictive of lower risk of T2D.",2023,diabetes
38750304,The role of low glycemic index and load diets in medical nutrition therapy for type 2 diabetes: an update.,"The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its microvascular and macrovascular complications necessitate an optimal approach to prevention and management. Medical nutrition therapy serves as the cornerstone of diabetes care, reducing reliance on diabetic medications for glycemic control and mitigating cardiovascular risk. The broadening field of research in the effect of low glycemic index (GI) and/or glycemic load (GL) diets on individuals with T2DM has yielded promising results in the existing literature. Adopting low-GI and GL dietary patterns contributes to minimizing fluctuations in blood glucose levels, thus presenting a good strategy for achieving enhanced glycemic control. Furthermore, the above dietary practices may offer a viable alternative and practical approach to weight management in individuals with T2DM. However, clinical practice guidelines for diabetes dietary management show inconsistency regarding the certainty of evidence supporting the implementation of low-GI/GL nutritional patterns. This review aims to thoroughly evaluate the available data on the effectiveness of low-GI and low-GL diets in managing glycemic control and reducing cardiovascular risk factors.",2024,diabetes
37299535,Endothelial Glycocalyx Preservation-Impact of Nutrition and Lifestyle.,"The endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) is a dynamic hair-like layer expressed on the apical surface of endothelial cells throughout the vascular system. This layer serves as an endothelial cell gatekeeper by controlling the permeability and adhesion properties of endothelial cells, as well as by controlling vascular resistance through the mediation of vasodilation. Pathogenic destruction of the eGC could be linked to impaired vascular function, as well as several acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. Defining the precise functions and mechanisms of the eGC is perhaps the limiting factor of the missing link in finding novel treatments for lifestyle-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. However, the relationship between diet, lifestyle, and the preservation of the eGC is an unexplored territory. This article provides an overview of the eGC's importance for health and disease and describes perspectives of nutritional therapy for the prevention of the eGC's pathogenic destruction. It is concluded that vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, as well as healthy dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet and the time management of eating, might show promise for preserving eGC health and, thus, the health of the cardiovascular system.",2023,diabetes
39599740,Targeting the Gut Microbiota for Prevention and Management of Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder with a heterogeneous etiology encompassing societal and behavioral risk factors in addition to genetic and environmental susceptibility. The cardiovascular consequences of diabetes account for more than two-thirds of mortality among people with T2D. Not only does T2D shorten life expectancy, but it also lowers quality of life and is associated with extremely high health expenditures since diabetic complications raise both direct and indirect healthcare costs. An increasing body of research indicates a connection between T2D and gut microbial traits, as numerous alterations in the intestinal microorganisms have been noted in pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals. These include pro-inflammatory bacterial patterns, increased intestinal permeability, endotoxemia, and hyperglycemia-favoring conditions, such as the alteration of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. Restoring microbial homeostasis can be very beneficial for preventing and co-treating T2D and improving antidiabetic therapy outcomes. This review summarizes the characteristics of a ""diabetic"" microbiota and the metabolites produced by microbial species that can worsen or ameliorate T2D risk and progression, suggesting gut microbiota-targeted strategies to restore eubiosis and regulate blood glucose. Nutritional supplementation, diet, and physical exercise are known to play important roles in T2D, and here their effects on the gut microbiota are discussed, suggesting non-pharmacological approaches that can greatly help in diabetes management and highlighting the importance of tailoring treatments to individual needs.",2024,diabetes

This is necessary to achieve the goals of improving overall metabolic measures beyond calorie restriction and weight loss. Misconceptions about nutrition in T2DM add to the challenges of executing MNT in a culturally sensitive population. The current review provides insights into MNT for the prevention and management of T2DM in India, based on both evidence and experience. It revisits historical Indian studies and provides information on appropriate dietary intake of carbohydrates (60-70%), proteins (~ 20%) and fats (10%) that will be acceptable and beneficial in an Indian T2DM population. It discusses nuances of types of carbohydrates and fats and explains associations of increased dietary fiber intake, balanced intake of low and high glycemic index foods and substitution of saturated fats with plant-based polyunsaturated fats in improving outcomes of T2DM and attenuating risk factors. The article also deliberates upon special patient populations with comorbid conditions and diseases and the necessary adjustments needed in their nutritional care. It outlines a step-wise approach to MNT involving a careful interplay of nutrition assessment, diagnosis, individualization and patient counseling.

26177573,Type-2 diabetes: Current understanding and future perspectives.,"The rapid outbreak of type-2 diabetes is one of the largest public health problems around the globe. Particularly, the developing nations are becoming the epicenters of cardiometabolic disorders owing to the change in lifestyle and diet preference besides genetic predisposition. Diabetes has become a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in South Asian countries including India. The pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes primarily initiates with inadequacy of pancreatic islet β-cells to respond to chronic fuel surfeit and hence causing glycemic load, insulin resistance, and obesity. Urban Indian life is threatened with unhealthy high calorie diet and sedentary habits, and thus impairing the metabolic status of ""thin-fat Indians"" and rendering them more vulnerable to metabolic disorders. Furthermore, the metabolic dysfunction may be triggered off quite early in life due to poor maternal health and impairment in intrauterine programming and, particularly in rural India. The impaired fetal development affects the health status in later stage of life by promoting obesity, insulin resistance, type-2 diabetes, and cardiovascular complications. Therefore, the preventive and therapeutic approaches focus on a holistic strategy to improve maternal and child health, promote balanced diet and physical exercise in combination with pharmacological intervention of reducing/checking hyperglycemia, obesity, and cardiovascular complications.

39674193,"Health outcomes, environmental impacts, and diet costs of adherence to the EAT-Lancet Diet in China in 1997-2015: a health and nutrition survey.","In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission proposed a global reference dietary pattern. Although research on the EAT-Lancet reference diet and its associations with mortality, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, dietary environmental impacts, and cost of diets is increasing, studies done in low-income and middle-income countries remain scarce. This study aimed to assess the health outcomes, environmental impacts, and dietary costs of adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet in China. In this health and nutrition survey study, 16 029 participants from the China Health and Nutrition Survey cohort (1997-2015) were included at baseline. All-cause mortality was reported by family members and risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes was self-reported. 3-day 24 h recall was used to assess adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet (Eat-Lancet Diet Index [ELDI]), diet-related environmental impacts (greenhouse-gas emissions [GHGE]), total water use (TWU), land use, and dietary costs in each survey round. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the ELDI-score were obtained by Cox models with time-varying covariates, adjusted for potential confounders. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression was used to assess the association of environmental impacts and dietary costs to the ELDI score. During a median follow-up of 9·86 years, 803 new cases of incident type 2 diabetes, 563 new cases of cardiovascular disease, and 908 cases of all-cause mortality were recorded. At baseline, the ELDI score ranged from 9·4 points to 110·8 points on a scale of 0 to 140, with a mean of 55·3 points (SD 11·8). With each SD increase in the ELDI score, there was an 8% decreased risk of mortality (95% CI 2·2-14·1), a 16·1% decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (9·2-20·3), and a 25·3% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (19·5- 28·4). Each SD increase in the index was associated with a decrease of 2·2% (95% CI -2·6 to -1·8) in GHGE, 2·3% (-2·6 to -2·0) in land use, no association with TWU, but an increase in diet costs of 3·3% (2·8 to 3·8). High adherence to the ELDI was associated with a lower risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. However, the association with diet-related GHGE and land use was modest, and adherence was also linked to higher diet costs. The study advocates for the integration of sustainable indicators into future Chinese dietary guidelines. Additionally, policy measures such as agricultural subsidies on fruit and vegetable and carbon taxes on red meat are recommended to increase affordability, reduce environmental impact, and enhance the overall sustainability of dietary practices in China.

31967962,"Cognitive impairments in type 2 diabetes, risk factors and preventive strategies.","Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a modifiable risk factor in progression of several diseases including dementia and type 2 diabetes. If cognitive impairments are not reversed at an early stage of appearance of symptoms, then the prolonged pathogenesis can lead to dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, it is necessary to detect the risk factors and mechanism of prevention of cognitive dysfunction at an early stage of disease. Poor lifestyle, age, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammation are some of the major risk factors that contribute to cognitive and memory impairments in diabetic patients. Mild cognitive impairment was seen in those individuals of type 2 diabetes, who are on an unhealthy diet. Physical inactivity, frequent alcohol consumptions, and use of packed food products that provides an excess of cheap calories are found associated with cognitive impairment and depression in diabetic patients. Omega fatty acids (FAs) and polyphenol-rich foods, especially flavonoids, can reduce the bad effects of an unhealthy lifestyle; therefore, the consumption of omega FAs and flavonoids may be beneficial in maintaining normal cognitive function. These functional foods may improve cognitive functions by targeting many enzymes and molecules in cells chiefly through their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, or signaling actions. Here, we provide the current concepts on the risk factors of cognitive impairments in type 2 diabetes and the mechanism of prevention, using omega FAs and bioactive compounds obtained from fruits and vegetables.

30218282,Preventing Type 2 Diabetes with Home Cooking: Current Evidence and Future Potential.,"Various dietary regimes have proven effective in preventing diabetes, yet its prevalence is growing. This review's goals are to examine the relationship between home cooking and diabetes and to present the literature on home cooking education programs as a novel strategy to improve adherence to healthy nutrition, thus decreasing the risk of diabetes. Consumption of home-cooked food is linked to healthier nutrition and decreased risk of diabetes. Further, home cooking interventions have a short-term positive impact on nutritional intake of both children and adults, and on diabetes prevention. Well-designed randomized controlled studies are needed to rigorously evaluate the long-term impact of home cooking interventions on cooking behavior, dietary intake, diabetes, and healthcare costs. Culinary education is an emerging field that aims to change nutrition education paradigms. Clinicians can empower patients to adopt home cooking by role modeling home cooking themselves, including home cooking content in their medical encounters, and through comprehensive lifestyle medicine interventions.",2018,diabetes
37511996,Superfoods for Type 2 Diabetes: A Narrative Review and Proposal for New International Recommendations.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease affecting an estimated 537 million individuals worldwide. 'Superfoods' can be integrated into the diet of T2DM patients due to their health benefits. Study Objectives: (i) To carry out a narrative review of 'superfoods' with the potential to reduce glycaemic levels in T2DM patients (2019 to 2022), (ii) to identify 'superfoods' with the potential to reduce HbA1c and (iii) to propose new guidance on the use of 'superfoods'. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: A narrative review was carried out using the databases PubMed, SciELO, DOAJ and Google Scholar. The keywords were [""type 2 diabetes"" and (""food"" or ""diet"" or ""nutrition"") and (""glycaemia"" or ""glycemia"")]. Only review studies were included. <i>Results</i>: Thirty reviews were selected. The 'superfoods' identified as having a potential impact on glycaemic control were foods with polyphenols (e.g., berries), fermented dairy products, whole cereals/grains, nuts and proteins, among others. The possibility of an extensive reduction in Hb1Ac was reported for fermented dairy products, especially yoghurts enriched with vitamin D or probiotics (HbA1c reduction of around 1%) or by increasing the fibre intake by 15 g (or up to 35 g) (HbA1c reduction of around 2%). <i>Conclusion</i>: It is recommended that the identified 'superfoods' are included in the diet of T2DM patients, although this should not substitute an appropriate diet and exercise plan. In particular, yoghurts and an increased fibre intake (by 15 g or up to 35 g) can be used as nutraceuticals. New recommendations on the introduction of 'superfoods' in the diet of T2DM patients have been proposed.",2023,diabetes
27910746,Nutrition and Diabetes Mellitus: How are They Interlinked?,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has risen exponentially, and the number of incidences increases every day. The purpose of this article is to summarize the experimental evidence supporting the important association between nutrition and diet-based therapy for the control and management of T2DM. Evidence from several in vitro, in vivo, and human studies broadly found that nutrition-based therapy enriched with several important phytochemical constituents modulates lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and it ameliorates glucolipotoxicity and insulin resistance. Besides these activities, nutrition-based therapy has also been shown to improve adipose tissue metabolism and to alleviate various proinflammatory processes, oxidative stress, and stress-sensitive signaling pathways. Dietary recommendations for patients with type 2 diabetes emphasize diet-based therapy and include excellent sources of dietary fibers and polyphenols.",2016,diabetes
39415250,A comprehensive lifestyle index and its associations with DNA methylation and type 2 diabetes among Ghanaian adults: the rodam study.,"A series of modifiable lifestyle factors, such as diet quality, physical activity, alcohol intake, and smoking, may drive the rising burden of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) among sub-Saharan Africans globally. It is unclear whether epigenetic changes play a mediatory role in the associations between these lifestyle factors and T2DM. We assessed the associations between a comprehensive lifestyle index, DNA methylation and T2DM among Ghanaian adults. We used whole-blood Illumina 450 k DNA methylation data from 713 Ghanaians from the Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. We constructed a comprehensive lifestyle index based on established cut-offs for diet quality, physical activity, alcohol intake, and smoking status. In the T2DM-free discovery cohort (n = 457), linear models were fitted to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with the lifestyle index after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and technical covariates. Associations between the identified DMPs and the primary outcome (T2DM), as well as secondary outcomes (fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1c), were determined via logistic and linear regression models, respectively. In the present study population (mean age: 52 ± 10 years; male: 42.6%), the comprehensive lifestyle index showed a significant association with one DMP annotated to an intergenic region on chromosome 7 (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.024). Others were annotated to ADCY7, SMARCE1, AHRR, LOXL2, and PTBP1 genes. One DMR was identified and annotated to the GFPT2 gene (familywise error rate (FWER) from bumphunter bootstrap = 0.036). None of the DMPs showed significant associations with T2DM; directions of effect were positive for the DMP in the AHRR and inverse for all the other DMPs. Higher methylation of the ADCY7 DMP was associated with higher FBG (p = 0.024); LOXL2 DMP was associated with lower FBG (p = 0.023) and HbA1c (p = 0.049); and PTBP1 DMP was associated with lower HbA1c (p = 0.002). In this explorative epigenome-wide association study among Ghanaians, we identified one DMP and DMR associated with a comprehensive lifestyle index not previously associated with individual lifestyle factors. Based on our findings, we infer that lifestyle factors in combination, affect DNA methylation, thereby influencing the risk of T2DM among Ghanaian adults living in different contexts.",2024,diabetes
39998924,Navigating the Spectrum of 4 Evidence-Based Nutrition Options for Type 2 Diabetes Management.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex, pervasive disease that creates a health and financial burden. The goal is to head off progression to insulin requirement, and dietary changes have been recognized as a first-line intervention in the treatment protocol. Four evidence-based nutritional options are reviewed and their benefits for metabolic consequences. We conducted a comprehensive search of relevant literature using the PubMed database for recent systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and original research articles. The Mediterranean and plant-based diets have demonstrated benefits for the prevention and treatment of diabetes, weight reduction, lipid improvements, and overall cardiovascular risk reduction. A low carbohydrate diet is another viable option for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction, though it is not as uniformly defined and is difficult to maintain long term. The ketogenic diet is similarly very restrictive and produces significant HbA1c reductions. Type 2 diabetes prevention and treatment is crucial in this widespread disease. The first-line treatment is lifestyle modifications with dietary interventions being at the forefront. With a unique clinical model and a variety of dietary options, our program strives for individualized evidence-based care. Nutritional modifications are the best initial approaches to overcoming insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. All dietary modifications, like any medical intervention, require education on benefits vs risks.",2025,diabetes
32583417,Relationship between FGF21 and drug or nondrug therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Sedentary and high-calorie diets are associated with increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, while exercise and diet control are also important nondrug treatments for diabetes. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an important cytokine, which is mainly expressed in liver, fat and muscle tissue responding to nutrition and exercise, and plays an important role in the improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism. Due to the increasing serum FGF21 level in obesity and diabetes, FGF21 can be used as a predictor or biomarker of diabetes. A variety of clinical antidiabetic drugs can reduce the content of FGF21, possibly for the improvement of FGF21 sensitivity. In this paper, we reviewed the interactions between FGF21 and nondrug therapy (diet and exercise) for diabetes and explored the potential value of the combined application of clinical antidiabetic drugs and FGF21.",2021,diabetes
28934987,Lifestyle precision medicine: the next generation in type 2 diabetes prevention?,"The driving force behind the current global type 2 diabetes epidemic is insulin resistance in overweight and obese individuals. Dietary factors, physical inactivity, and sedentary behaviors are the major modifiable risk factors for obesity. Nevertheless, many overweight/obese people do not develop diabetes and lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss and diabetes prevention are often ineffective. Traditionally, chronically elevated blood glucose concentrations have been the hallmark of diabetes; however, many individuals will either remain 'prediabetic' or regress to normoglycemia. Thus, there is a growing need for innovative strategies to tackle diabetes at scale. The emergence of biomarker technologies has allowed more targeted therapeutic strategies for diabetes prevention (precision medicine), though largely confined to pharmacotherapy. Unlike most drugs, lifestyle interventions often have systemic health-enhancing effects. Thus, the pursuance of lifestyle precision medicine in diabetes seems rational. Herein, we review the literature on lifestyle interventions and diabetes prevention, describing the biological systems that can be characterized at scale in human populations, linking them to lifestyle in diabetes, and consider some of the challenges impeding the clinical translation of lifestyle precision medicine.",2017,diabetes
28685623,Cardiovascular disease prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with several cardiovascular (CV) risk factors such as insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as well as platelet and haemostatic abnormalities increasing the risk of thrombosis. Therefore, T2DM patients are at an increased risk for CV disease (CVD). Areas covered: This narrative review discusses the treatment of T2DM. This includes lifestyle measures (diet, exercise and smoking cessation) as well as hypolipidaemic, antihypertensive, weight reducing, antiplatelet and glucose lowering drugs. The focus is on the effects of these therapeutic strategies on CVD risk. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) reporting CVD outcomes with such drugs in T2DM patients are also reviewed. Expert opinion: Apart from current guidelines, the findings of RCTs on CVD outcomes in T2DM patients should be taken into consideration in daily clinical practice. Multiple risk factors should be targeted simultaneously in such high-risk patients in order to efficiently reduce the risk of CV events.",2017,diabetes
31121637,The effects of popular diets on type 2 diabetes management.,"Type 2 diabetes can be managed with the use of diabetes self-management skills. Diet and exercise are essential segments of the lifestyle changes necessary for diabetes management. However, diet recommendations can be complicated in a world full of different diets. This review aims to evaluate the evidence on the effects of three popular diets geared towards diabetes management: low-carbohydrate and ketogenic diet, vegan diet, and the Mediterranean diet. While all three diets have been shown to assist in improving glycaemic control and weight loss, patient adherence, acceptability, and long-term manageability play essential roles in the efficacy of each diet.",2019,diabetes
40185534,Emerging biomarkers in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition caused by high blood glucose resulting from insufficient insulin production or cellular resistance to insulin action or both. It is one of the fastest-growing public health concerns worldwide. Development of long-term nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease are some of the complications commonly associated with poor blood glycemic control. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the most prevalent type of diabetes, accounts for around 95 % of all cases globally. Although middle-aged or older adults are more likely to develop T2DM, its prevalence has grown in children and young people due to increased obesity, sedentary lifestyle and poor nutrition. Furthermore, it is believed that more than 50 % of cases go undiagnosed annually. Routine screening is essential to ensure early detection and reduce risk of life-threatening complications. Herein, we review traditional biomarkers and highlight the ongoing pursuit of novel and efficacious biomarkers driven by the objective of achieving early, precise and prompt diagnoses. It is widely acknowledged that individual biomarkers will inevitably have certain limitations necessitating the need for integrating multiple markers in screening.",2025,diabetes
30521416,Diet and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: beyond weight loss and exercise.,"Insulin resistance (IR) and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction are core pathophysiologic features of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Select lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions, including weight loss, physical activity, a Mediterranean diet intervention, and hypoglycemic agents, have been shown to prevent or delay T2DM. However, dietary factors other than weight loss may also impact risk, mainly through effects to enhance insulin sensitivity, although some may also directly or indirectly impact pancreatic beta-cell function. A literature review of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted, and the research indicates dietary factors showing promise for reducing T2DM risk include higher intakes of cereal fibers, unsaturated fatty acids, magnesium, and polyphenols (e.g. anthocyanins), while reducing dietary glycemic load, added sugars, and high-sugar beverages. While these dietary factors are mainly supported by evidence from observational studies and RCTs of surrogate markers for T2DM, they are consistent with current recommendations to emphasize consumption of whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, seafood, fruits, and vegetables, while limiting intakes of saturated fatty acids, refined carbohydrates, and processed meats. Additional dietary intervention RCTs are needed to assess the efficacy of these promising dietary interventions for delaying or preventing the onset of T2DM.",2019,diabetes
40334765,"Socioeconomic Deprivation, Unhealthy Lifestyle, and Premature Mortality in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: A Population-Based Longitudinal Study.","Adverse health behaviors have been found to play a role in linking socioeconomic deprivation and mortality, but relevant evidence in patients with type 2 diabetes is lacking. We aimed to quantify the mediation effect of overall lifestyles on the association between socioeconomic deprivation and premature mortality as well as the interaction of deprivation and lifestyle in diabetes. This cohort study included 20,463 UK Biobank participants with type 2 diabetes at recruitment between 2006 and 2010. Socioeconomic deprivation level was determined using the Townsend deprivation index. An overall lifestyle score was constructed based on 6 health behaviors including smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diet, sleep duration, and television viewing time. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to investigate the associations of socioeconomic deprivation and lifestyle with premature mortality. Over a mean follow-up of 7.4-12.7 years, 3381, 2382, 1281, and 577 patients with diabetes died before ages 80, 75, 70, and 65 years, respectively. High socioeconomic deprivation showed an association with a higher risk of premature mortality that was partially mediated by overall lifestyles. A significant interaction was found between lifestyle and deprivation on premature mortality, which became more apparent as age at death decreased. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death before age 80 years when comparing the unfavorable versus favorable lifestyle was 1.49 (95% CI 1.21-1.82) in the least deprived group and 1.92 (1.56-2.36) in the most deprived group. Equivalent HRs for death before age 65 years were 1.33 (0.76-2.33) and 3.78 (2.04-7.02), respectively. In patients with type 2 diabetes, unhealthy lifestyles mediated the association between socioeconomic deprivation and premature mortality and conferred disproportionate risk of premature mortality in more deprived groups.",2025,diabetes
35593923,Precision nutrition in diabetes: when population-based dietary advice gets personal.,"Diet plays a fundamental role in maintaining long-term health, with healthful diets being endorsed by current dietary guidelines for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. However, the response to dietary interventions varies widely, highlighting the need for refinement and personalisation beyond population-based 'one size fits all'. This article reviews the clinical evidence supporting precision nutrition as a fundamental approach for dietary advice in diabetes. Further, it proposes a framework for the eventual implementation of precision nutrition and discusses key challenges for the application of this approach in the prevention of diabetes. One implication of this approach is that precision nutrition would not exclude the parallel goal of population-based healthy dietary advice. Nevertheless, the shift in prioritising precision nutrition is needed to reflect the dynamic nature of responses to dietary interventions that vary among individuals and change over the life course.",2022,diabetes
26475162,Lifestyle interventions in preventing new type 2 diabetes in Asian populations.,"The aim of this study was to review current evidence on interventional studies aimed at the prevention of type 2 diabetes in Asian population with lifestyle interventions. Prevalence of type 2 diabetes sharply increased in most Asian countries during the last decades. This issue has now also relevant implication for Europe where different surveys are also consistently revealing an higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes and other and major CVD risk factors among subjects originating from Asian Countries than in the native population. Nutrition and lifestyle transition seem to play a role in disclosing the predisposition for the development of type 2 diabetes and great interest is now shown toward the possibility to intervene with lifestyle intervention on at risk populations. A meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials showed that lifestyle interventions are highly effective also in the Asian population. All studies were, however, conducted with an individual approach based on the identification of high-risk individuals. When ethnic minority groups have to be addressed, an approach directed to the community rather than to the individual might, however, be more effective. This review reinforces the importance for policy-makers to consider the involvement of the whole community of minority immigrant groups with lifestyle intervention programs.",2016,diabetes
34277958,Diabetes prevention interventions for women after gestational diabetes mellitus: an overview of reviews.,"To present an overview of reviews of interventions for the prevention of diabetes in women after gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with the overall aim of gaining information in order to establish local interventions. Six databases were searched for quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods systematic reviews. All types of interventions or screening programmes were eligible. The outcomes were effectiveness of reducing diabetes incidence, encouraging healthy behavioural changes and enhancing women's perceptions of their increased risks of developing type 2 diabetes following GDM. Eighteen reviews were included: three on screening programmes and seven on participation and risk perceptions. Interventions promoting physical activity, healthy diet, breastfeeding and antidiabetic medicine reported significantly decreased incidence of postpartum diabetes, up to 34% reduction after any breastfeeding compared to none. Effects were larger if the intervention began early after birth and lasted longer. Participation in screening rose up to 40% with face-to-face recruitment in a GDM healthcare setting. Interventions were mainly based in healthcare settings and involved up to nine health professions, councillors and peer educators, mostly dieticians. Women reported a lack of postpartum care and demonstrated a low knowledge of risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes. Typical barriers to participation were lack of awareness of increased risk and low levels of support from family. Lifestyle interventions or pharmacological treatment postpartum was effective in decreasing diabetes incidence following GDM. Women's knowledge of the risk of diabetes and importance of physical activity was insufficient. Early face-to-face recruitment increased participation in screening. Programmes aimed at women following a diagnosis of GDM ought to provide professional and social support, promote screening, breastfeeding, knowledge of risk factors, be long-lasting and offered early after birth, preferably by face-to-face recruitment.",2021,diabetes
37406880,Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes in the Multiethnic Cohort.,"In this report, we investigated the association between established risk factors and type 2 diabetes (T2D) across 5 distinct ethnic groups and explored differences according to T2D definition within the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study. Using the full MEC, with participants in Hawaii and Los Angeles (N=172,230), we applied Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All participants completed questionnaires asking about demographics, anthropometrics, lifestyle factors, and regular diet. T2D status was determined from self-reported diagnosis/medication and Medicare claims. We assessed the associations between well-established risk factors and T2D in the full cohort, after stratification by ethnic group, according to the T2D definition, and in a biorepository subset. Effect modification by ethnicity was evaluated using Wald's tests. Overall, 46,500 (27%) participants had an incident T2D diagnosis after a mean follow-up of 17.1±6.9 years. All predictors were significantly associated with T2D: overweight (HR=1.74), obesity (HR=2.90), red meat intake (HR=1.15), short (HR=1.04) and long (HR=1.08) sleep duration, and smoking (HR=1.26) predicted a significantly higher T2D incidence, whereas coffee (HR=0.90) and alcohol (HR=0.78) consumption, physical activity (HR=0.89), and diet quality (HR=0.96) were associated with lower T2D incidence. The strength of these associations was similar across ethnic groups with noteworthy disparities for overweight/obesity, physical activity, alcohol intake, coffee consumption, and diet quality. These findings confirm the importance of known risk factors for T2D across ethnic groups, but small differences were detected that may contribute to disparate incidence rates in some ethnic groups, especially for obesity and physical activity.",2023,diabetes
31529998,Gender and diet management in type 2 diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes is a chronic health condition that requires ongoing self-management. This often includes changes in diet, which may be open to influences from relatives. Family support in terms of diet may be linked with gender and the assumption that meal preparation is a traditionally female activity. This article looks at the role of gender in diet management in people with type 2 diabetes and their relatives. Seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 participants (10 people with type 2 diabetes, 13 relatives of people with type 2 diabetes) in Scotland, UK. The aim was to uncover changes people have made to their diet following diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in oneself or a family member. Data were analysed using Framework Approach.<b>Findings:</b> Female relatives were more likely to manage the patient's diet while male relatives provided support but were less likely to monitor the person's diet. Female patients may prioritise the needs of their family while male patients are more likely to rely on their female relatives in terms of diet management. The study findings have implications for family-based interventions as gender may play a crucial role in the management of type 2 diabetes.",2021,diabetes
31586321,Nutritional Models of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"In order to better understand the events that precede and precipitate the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), several nutritional animal models have been developed. These models are generated by manipulating the diet of either the animal itself, or its mother during her pregnancy, and in comparison to traditional genetic and knock out models, have the advantage that they more accurately reflect the etiology of human T2DM. This chapter will discuss some of the most widely used nutritional models of T2DM: Diet-induced obesity (DIO) in adult rodents, and studies of offspring of mothers fed a low-protein, high-fat and/or high-sugar diet during pregnancy and/or lactation. Several common mechanisms have been identified through which these nutritional manipulations can lead to metabolic disease, including pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, impaired insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, and the excess accumulation of visceral adipose tissue and consequent deposition of nonesterified fatty acids in peripheral tissues. In addition, there is an emerging concept that obesity/poor quality diets result in increased production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from adipose tissue leading to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, and that this is likely to represent an important link between obesity/diet and metabolic dysfunction. The following chapter will discuss the most common nutritional models of T2DM in experimental animals, their application, and relationship to human etiology, and will highlight the important insights these models have provided into the pathogenesis of T2DM.",2020,diabetes
39744912,The Rise of Type 2 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents: An Emerging Pandemic.,"This review explores the increasing prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents, focusing on its etiology, risk factors, complications, and the importance of early detection and management. It also highlights the need for a multidisciplinary, family-centered approach in managing T2DM in pediatric populations, with an emphasis on nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle interventions. A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus to incorporate studies from 2015 to 2024 on T2DM in youths/adolescents/children, focusing on epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention strategies. Studies on Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) or adult populations were excluded. T2DM is a complex metabolic disorder with various societal, behavioral, environmental, and genetic risk factors. It accounts for one in three new childhood diabetes cases, with rising incidence among American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, and Hispanic/Latino children. The increase in T2DM incidence correlates with growing childhood obesity rates. Early onset significantly raises the risk of complications like retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Early detection, screening, and treatment can prevent or delay these complications. A family-centered, multidisciplinary approach is essential for effective management, including lifestyle and behavioral support. T2DM in children is a growing health concern with severe implications. Early detection and management, including nutrition and exercise counseling, are critical in reducing long-term complications. A multidisciplinary approach is vital for improving outcomes and minimizing morbidity and mortality.",2025,diabetes
35357559,"Association of gut microbiota with glycaemic traits and incident type 2 diabetes, and modulation by habitual diet: a population-based longitudinal cohort study in Chinese adults.","The gut microbiome is mainly shaped by diet, and varies across geographical regions. Little is known about the longitudinal association of gut microbiota with glycaemic control. We aimed to identify gut microbiota prospectively associated with glycaemic traits and type 2 diabetes in a geographically diverse population, and examined the cross-sectional association of dietary or lifestyle factors with the identified gut microbiota. The China Health and Nutrition Survey is a population-based longitudinal cohort covering 15 provinces/megacities across China. Of the participants in that study, 2772 diabetes-free participants with a gut microbiota profile based on 16S rRNA analysis were included in the present study (age 50.8 ± 12.7 years, mean ± SD). Using a multivariable-adjusted linear mixed-effects model, we examined the prospective association of gut microbiota with glycaemic traits (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA<sub>1c</sub> and HOMA-IR). We constructed a healthy microbiome index (HMI), and used Poisson regression to examine the relationship between the HMI and incident type 2 diabetes. We evaluated the association of dietary or lifestyle factors with the glycaemic trait-related gut microbiota using a multivariable-adjusted linear regression model. After follow-up for 3 years, 123 incident type 2 diabetes cases were identified. We identified 25 gut microbial genera positively or inversely associated with glycaemic traits. The newly created HMI (per SD unit) was inversely associated with incident type 2 diabetes (risk ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.58, 0.84). Furthermore, we found that several microbial genera that were favourable for the glycaemic trait were consistently associated with healthy dietary habits (higher consumption of vegetable, fruit, fish and nuts). Our results revealed multiple gut microbiota prospectively associated with glycaemic traits and type 2 diabetes in a geographically diverse population, and highlighted the potential of gut microbiota-based diagnosis or therapy for type 2 diabetes.

36837488,The Role of Lifestyle Interventions in the Prevention and Treatment of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common pregnancy-related endocrinopathies, affecting up to 25% of pregnancies globally. GDM increases the risk of perinatal and delivery complications, and the chance of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications, including cardiovascular diseases. This elevated risk is then passed on to the next generation, creating a cycle of metabolic dysfunction across generations. For many years, GDM preventive measures have had inconsistent results, but recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have identified promising new preventative routes. This review aims to summarize the evidence investigating the efficacy of lifestyle treatments for the prevention of GDM and to summarize the effects of two lifestyle interventions, including physical activity and dietary interventions. Based on the present research, future studies should be conducted to investigate whether initiating lifestyle interventions during the preconception period is more beneficial in preventing GDM. In addition, research targeting pregnancy should be designed with a personalized approach. Therefore, studies should customize intervention approaches depending on the presence of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors at the individual level.",2023,diabetes
30515634,Nutrition Interventions for Type 2 Diabetes in Chinese Populations: A Scoping Review.,"Developing culturally appropriate diabetes nutrition interventions for immigrants could be facilitated knowing what is successful in the home country and other relevant countries. The primary purpose of this scoping review was to identify the design and delivery methods of nutrition interventions for Chinese populations with type 2 diabetes, in their home countries and as immigrants to western countries. A total of 14 articles was retrieved and included. Overall, the approaches used in China often were modelled on intensive lifestyle programs although alternative strategies were also identified. Most interventions were not focussed solely on nutrition, and only a few were conducted in community settings. Most of the interventions were delivered in a group format, while those conducted in China also included individual counselling, particularly for nutrition. In addition, the diabetes and nutrition-related outcomes, cultural relevance and acceptability, and other factors that influenced protocol compliance were considered. Improvements in blood glucose control were observed in participants in all interventions where it was measured. Participants reported increased nutritional knowledge but nutritional behaviour was generally not well documented. Trials conducted in the United States emphasized the importance of cultural adaptation of intervention programs, particularly with respect to dietary patterns and specific foods. Practice-transferable characteristics are highlighted. Research gaps included trials conducted in community settings with pragmatic implementation and evaluation, comparative trials of interventions to gauge relative effectiveness, and measuring and reporting dietary outcomes for better understanding of the impact on dietary behaviours and their relationship to health outcomes.",2019,diabetes
37609934,"Association of a Healthy Lifestyle, Life's Essential 8 Scores With Incident Macrovascular and Microvascular Disease Among Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes.","Background The association of a healthy lifestyle with the prognosis of type 2 diabetes remains uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the associations of a healthy lifestyle and a higher American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 score with incident macrovascular and microvascular diseases in type 2 diabetes. Methods and Results A total of 13 543 participants with baseline type 2 diabetes and free of macrovascular and microvascular diseases from the UK Biobank were included. A healthy lifestyle was determined based on body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, sleep duration, and diet. Life's Essential 8 scores were generated from 8 metrics according to the American Heart Association's cardiovascular health advisory, ranging from 0 to 100. During a median follow-up of 12.1 years, 3279 (24.2%) incident macrovascular diseases and 2557 (18.9%) microvascular diseases were documented. Compared with those with a poor lifestyle, participants with an ideal lifestyle had significantly lower risks of incident macrovascular disease (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46 [95% CI, 0.36-0.59]) and microvascular disease (HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.47-0.77]). Significantly lower risks of macrovascular disease (HR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.05-0.79]) and microvascular disease (HR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.06-0.98]) were also found in the high cardiovascular health group (Life's Essential 8 scores: 80-100), compared to the low cardiovascular health group (scores: 0-49). Adhering to an ideal lifestyle may prevent 37.0% of macrovascular disease and 24.7% of microvascular disease, and attaining a high cardiovascular health may prevent 71.9% of macrovascular disease and 67.5% of microvascular disease. Conclusions A healthy lifestyle and a higher Life's Essential 8 score were associated with lower risks of macrovascular and microvascular diseases among participants with type 2 diabetes.",2023,diabetes
37123391,Effects of dietary vitamins on obesity-related metabolic parameters.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Genetic factors, some underlying medical conditions, and obesity are risk factors of T2DM. Unlike other risk factors which are non-modifiable, obesity is preventable and usually treatable, and is largely contributed by lifestyle factors. Management of these lifestyle factors may curb the development of T2DM and reduces T2DM prevalence. Dietary vitamins have been recommended as a lifestyle modification intervention to support obesity treatment. Vitamins correlate negatively with body weight, body mass index and body composition. Some of the vitamins may also have anti-adipogenic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. However, results from pre-clinical and clinical studies of the effects of vitamins on obesity are inconsistent.

28049284,Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy, is characterized by underlying maternal defects in the β-cell response to insulin during pregnancy. Women with a previous history of GDM have a greater than 7-fold higher risk of developing postpartum diabetes compared with women without GDM. Various risk factors for postpartum diabetes have been identified, including maternal age, glucose levels in pregnancy, family history of diabetes, pre-pregnancy and postpartum body mass index, dietary patterns, physical activity, and breastfeeding. Genetic studies revealed that GDM shares common genetic variants with type 2 diabetes. A number of lifestyle interventional trials that aimed to ameliorate modifiable risk factors, including diet, exercise, and breastfeeding, succeeded in reducing the incidence of postpartum diabetes, weight retention, and other obesity-related morbidities. The present review summarizes the findings of previous studies on the incidence and risk factors of postpartum diabetes and discusses recent lifestyle interventional trials that attempted to prevent postpartum diabetes.",2017,diabetes
40090039,PNPLA3 gene variation modulates diet-induced improvement in liver lipid content in type 2 diabetes.,"Lifestyle-induced weight reduction remains crucial for managing type 2 diabetes and steatotic liver disease, but its effectiveness varies. We postulated that the G allele in the rs738409 single nucleotide polymorphism within patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), which associates with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, also modulates diet-related metabolic effects. Participants with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 8-week hypocaloric diets (energy intake: -1,256 kJ/d of, <30 kcal% fat): high in cereal fiber and coffee excluding red meat (HF-RM + C; n = 16), or low in cereal fiber, devoid of coffee, but high in red meat (LF + RM-C; n = 15). Whole-body insulin sensitivity (M value) was assessed using [<sup>2</sup>H]glucose and hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic clamps, hepatic lipid content (HCL) and body fat volumes by magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging before and after intervention. Despite comparable weight loss, HCL decreased more in non-carriers (-65 %) than in G-allele carriers (-36 %) upon HF-RM + C diet (both p < 0.05 vs baseline and between groups), but only among non-carriers (-46 %, p < 0.05 vs baseline) upon LF + RM-C. Upon HF-RM + C diet, increase in insulin sensitivity was not different between carriers (+27 % p = 0.051 from baseline) and non-carriers (+21 %, p = 0.032 from baseline), p > 0.05 for between-group comparison. Upon LF + RM-C diet, both groups equally improved their whole-body insulin sensitivity (+42 % for non-carriers and +37 % for carriers, p < 0.05 vs baseline). Upon HF-RM + C diet, non-carriers decreased circulating interleukin-18 from baseline by -31 %, whereas, upon LF + RM-C diet, non-carriers decreased circulating anti-inflammatory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist levels by 14 % (both p < 0.05 vs baseline). Humans with the PNPLA3 G-allele show modified dietary-induced effects on steatotic liver disease in type 2 diabetes despite body weight reduction.

34750331,Medical nutrition therapy using plant-focused low-protein meal plans for management of chronic kidney disease in diabetes.,"Nearly half of all Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD) also have type-2-diabetes (T2D). Whereas traditional and emerging pharmacotherapies are increasingly frequently used for the management of CKD in diabetes (CKD/DM), the role of integrated or multimodal interventions including the potentially synergistic and additive effect of diet and lifestyle modifications in addition to pharmacotherapy has not been well examined, in sharp contrast to the well-known integrated approaches to heart disease. Low-carbohydrate low-fat diets are often recommended in T2D, whereas low-protein diets (LPD) are recommended by guidelines for nondiabetic CKD with increasing emphasis on plant-based protein sources. High-protein diets with greater animal protein lead to glomerular hyperfiltration, especially in patients with T2D, and faster decline in renal function. Guidelines provide differing recommendations regarding the amount (low vs high) and source (plant vs animal) of dietary protein intake (DPI) in CKD/DM. Some such as KDIGO recommend 0.8 g/kg/day based on insufficient evidence for DPI restriction in CKD/DM, whereas KDOQI and ISRNM recommend a DPI of 0.6 to <0.8 g/kg/day. A patient-centered plant-focused LPD for the nutritional management of CKD/DM (PLAFOND), a type of PLADO diet comprising DPI of 0.6 to <0.8 g/kg/day with >50% plant-based sources, high dietary fiber, low glycemic index, and 25-35 Cal/kg/day energy, can be implemented by renal dietitians under Medical Nutrition Therapy. Potential risks vs benefits of high vs low protein intake in CKD/DM is unknown, for which expert recommendations remain opinion based. Randomized controlled studies are needed to examine safety, acceptability and efficacy of PLAFOND.",2022,diabetes
35533900,A comprehensive review on high -fat diet-induced diabetes mellitus: an epigenetic view.,"Modern lifestyle, genetics, nutritional overload through high-fat diet attributed prevalence and diabetes outcomes with various complications primarily due to obesity in which energy-dense diets frequently affect metabolic health. One possible issue usually associated with elevated chronic fat intake is insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia constitutes an important function in altering the carbohydrates and lipids metabolism. Similarly, in assessing human susceptibility to weight gain and obesity, genetic variations play a central role, contributing to keen interest in identifying the possible role of epigenetics as a mediator of gene-environmental interactions influencing the production of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its related concerns. Epigenetic modifications associated with the acceptance of a sedentary lifestyle and environmental stress factors in response to energy intake and expenditure imbalances complement genetic alterations and lead to the production and advancement of metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. Methylation of DNA, histone modifications, and increases in the expression of non-coding RNAs can result in reduced transcriptional activity of key β-cell genes thus creating insulin resistance. Epigenetics contribute to changes in the expression of the underlying insulin resistance and insufficiency gene networks, along with low-grade obesity-related inflammation, increased ROS generation, and DNA damage in multiorgans. This review focused on epigenetic mechanisms and metabolic regulations associated with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetes mellitus.",2022,diabetes
26885527,Lifestyle Interventions to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review of Economic Evaluation Studies.,"Objective. To summarize key findings of economic evaluations of lifestyle interventions for the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in high-risk subjects. Methods. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed original studies published since January 2009 in English, French, and Spanish. Eligible studies were identified through relevant databases including PubMed, Medline, National Health Services Economic Evaluation, CINHAL, EconLit, Web of sciences, EMBASE, and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature. Studies targeting obesity were also included. Data were extracted using a standardized method. The BMJ checklist was used to assess study quality. The heterogeneity of lifestyle interventions precluded a meta-analysis. Results. Overall, 20 studies were retained, including six focusing on obesity control. Seven were conducted within trials and 13 using modeling techniques. T2D prevention by physical activity or diet or both proved cost-effective according to accepted thresholds, except for five inconclusive studies, three on diabetes prevention and two on obesity control. Most studies exhibited limitations in reporting results, primarily with regard to generalizability and justification of selected sensitivity parameters. Conclusion. This confirms that lifestyle interventions for the primary prevention of diabetes are cost-effective. Such interventions should be further promoted as sound investment in the fight against diabetes.",2016,diabetes

Recent short-term studies have revealed that similar beneficial outcomes are seen after different dietary treatments for T2DM, with different approaches resulting in comparable weight loss and impacts on metabolic factors. More individualized approaches in nutrition therapy should be considered for T2DM patients and clinical guidelines should reflect this. More studies, especially long-term studies, are urgently needed on the impacts of the diets on different health parameters. Such studies should be prioritized because of the high and increasing prevalence of T2DM and because dietary changes may have greater benefits than previously thought. Furthermore, studies that focus on patient compliance to different types of diets, and personal and environmental factors that may affect compliance, are needed.",2017,diabetes
35179819,Lifestyle modification and inflammation in people with axial spondyloarthropathy-A scoping review.,"People with axial spondyloarthritis (AS) have an inflammatory profile, increasing the risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidaemia. Consequently, AS is linked with co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). Physical inactivity, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity influence inflammation, but knowledge of the interaction between these with inflammation, disease activity, and CVD risk in AS is dominated by cross-sectional research. A review of the literature was conducted between July 2020 and December 2021. The focus of the scoping review is to summarise longitudinal and randomised control trials in humans to investigate how tracking or modifying lifestyle influences inflammation and disease burden in patients with AS. (1) Lifestyle modifications, especially increased physical activity (PA), exercise, and smoking cessation, are critical in managing AS. (2) Smoking is negatively associated with patient reported outcome measures with AS, plus pharmaceutical treatment adherence, but links with structural radiographic progression are inconclusive. (3) Paucity of data warrant structured studies measuring inflammatory cytokine responses to lifestyle modification in AS. Increased PA, exercise, and smoking cessation should be supported at every given opportunity to improve health outcomes in patients with AS. The link between smoking and radiographic progression needs further investigation. Studies investigating the longitudinal effect of body weight, alcohol, and psychosocial factors on disease activity and physical function in patients with AS are needed. Given the link between inflammation and AS, future studies should also incorporate markers of chronic inflammation beyond the standard C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurements.",2022,diabetes
38261251,Nutritional Aspects to Cardiovascular Diseases and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"In this narrative review, we discuss the current evidence related to the role of dietary interventions to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We also propose alternative therapeutic strategies other than weight loss in this population, namely, improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and its determinants. While weight loss has been consistently associated with the prevention of T2DM and improvements in glycemic control in those with established diseases, its role in preventing and treating CVD is less clear. In fact, in this setting, improvements in diet quality have provided greater benefits, suggesting that this might represent an alternative, or an even more effective strategy than energy-restriction. Improvements in diet quality, with and without caloric restriction have been shown to improve CVD risk and to prevent the development of T2DM in individuals at risk; however, with regard to glycemic control in patients with T2DM, any dietary intervention resulting in significant weight loss may produce clinically meaningful benefits. Finally, dietary interventions with and without energy restriction that can improve cardiorespiratory fitness, even in absence of weight loss in patients with obesity, should be encouraged.",2024,diabetes
37101029,[Obesity and type 2 diabetes (Update 2023)].,"The body mass index (BMI) is a very crude measure of body fatness in individuals. Even normal weight persons can have too much body fat in cases of a lack of muscle mass (sarcopenia), which is why additional measurements of waist circumference and body fatness, e.g. bioimpedance analysis (BIA), are recommended. Lifestyle management including nutrition modification and increase in physical activity are important measures for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Regarding the treatment of type 2 diabetes, body weight is increasingly used as a secondary target parameter. The choice of anti-diabetic treatment and additional concomitant therapies is increasingly influenced by body weight. The importance of modern GLP‑1 agonists and dual GLP‑1 GIP agonists increases since these drugs target obesity and type 2 diabetes. Bariatric surgery is at present indicated with a BMI > 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with concomitant risk factors, such as diabetes and can lead at least to partial diabetes remission but has to be incorporated into an appropriate lifelong care concept.",2023,diabetes

38943015,Culturally Tailored Strategies to Enhance Type 2 Diabetes Care for South Asians in the United States.,"South Asian immigrants in the United States face an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This phenomenon has been linked to lifestyle factors and social determinants of health (SDOH) such as high-carbohydrate diet, limited physical activity, and stress from assimilation and other life challenges. Unfortunately, barriers stemming from language discordance, low health literacy, and certain cultural practices can hinder effective clinical management of T2DM among South Asian immigrants. In this perspective, we address these sociocultural barriers and propose culturally informed recommendations to improve healthcare delivery for South Asian groups and empower South Asian patients to self-manage T2DM. Our recommendations include (1) considerations and support for SDOH in South Asian communities, (2) culturally tailored healthcare delivery for South Asians, (3) mHealth technologies for T2DM education and self-management; and (4) enhanced epidemiological and South Asian-centric research.",2024,diabetes
38398847,Associations of Diet with Health Outcomes in the UK Biobank: A Systematic Review.,"The UK Biobank is a cohort study that collects data on diet, lifestyle, biomarkers, and health to examine diet-disease associations. Based on the UK Biobank, we reviewed 36 studies on diet and three health conditions: type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer. Most studies used one-time dietary data instead of repeated 24 h recalls, which may lead to measurement errors and bias in estimating diet-disease associations. We also found that most studies focused on single food groups or macronutrients, while few studies adopted a dietary pattern approach. Several studies consistently showed that eating more red and processed meat led to a higher risk of lung and colorectal cancer. The results suggest that high adherence to ""healthy"" dietary patterns (consuming various food types, with at least three servings/day of whole grain, fruits, and vegetables, and meat and processed meat less than twice a week) slightly lowers the risk of T2DM, CVD, and colorectal cancer. Future research should use multi-omics data and machine learning models to account for the complexity and interactions of dietary components and their effects on disease risk.",2024,diabetes

34591402,"Adolescent obesity treatments: news, views, and evidence.","Obesity is a complex and multifactorial disease that is influenced by physiological, environmental, socioeconomic, and genetic factors. In recent decades, this serious disease has impacted a large number of adolescents as a result of lifestyle factors. A lack of exercise and the consumption of excessive calories from an inadequate diet are the main contributors to adolescent obesity. However, genetic and hormonal factors might also play a role. The short- and long-term consequences of this disease include chronic issues such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disorders and an increase in early mortality rates. Although it is a serious disease, obesity in adolescents can be controlled with diet and exercise. When these lifestyle changes do not obtain the expected results, we can intensify the treatment by adding medication to the practice of diet and exercise. Additionally, for more severe cases, bariatric surgery can be an option. The purpose of this review is to clarify the current epidemiology, risks, and comorbidities and discuss news about the main treatments and the necessary improvements in this context.",2021,diabetes
36040543,Weight Loss Interventions and Skeletal Health in Persons with Diabetes.,"Weight loss is recommended for improving glycemic control and reducing cardiovascular risk factors in persons with diabetes. However, both diabetes and weight loss have been associated with detrimental skeletal health. This review aims to summarize recent study findings on the effects of lifestyle interventions for weight loss on skeletal health among persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D). A few large-scale observational studies have demonstrated an increased fragility fracture risk associated with weight loss among persons with T2D. Randomized control trials in persons with T2D also have shown that intentional lifestyle interventions for weight loss are associated with a greater decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) and an increase in the risk of fracture. The biological mechanisms underlying the compromised bone health during lifestyle interventions for weight loss are complex and not yet conclusive. However, there is evidence to suggest that bone loss and increased fracture risk during intentional weight loss may be mitigated by some intervention approaches, such as high protein intake, calcium supplementation, and resistance and balance training. There is still a lack of studies investigating the effects of different interventions for weight loss on skeletal health among persons with T2D. However, certain types of diet and physical activity intervention combined with bone monitoring and fracture risk prediction may help achieve weight loss goals and maintain skeletal health among persons with T2D during intentional weight loss.",2022,diabetes
34993570,Do gene-environment interactions have implications for the precision prevention of type 2 diabetes?,"The past decades have seen a rapid global rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. This surge has been driven by diabetogenic environmental changes that may act together with a genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes. It is possible that there is a synergistic gene-environment interaction, where the effects of the diabetogenic environment depend on the genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes. Randomised trials have shown that it is possible to delay, or even prevent the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals at elevated risk through behavioural modification, focusing on weight loss, physical activity and diet. There is wide heterogeneity between individuals regarding the effectiveness of these interventions, which could, in part, be due to genetic differences. However, the studies of gene-environment interactions performed thus far suggest that behavioural modifications appear equally effective in reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes from the stage of impaired glucose tolerance, regardless of the known underlying genetic predisposition. Recent studies suggest that there may be several subtypes of type 2 diabetes, which give new opportunities for gaining insight into gene-environment interactions. At present, the role of gene-environment interactions in the development of type 2 diabetes remains unclear. With many puzzle pieces missing in the general picture of type 2 diabetes development, the available evidence of gene-environment interactions is not ready for translation to individualised type 2 diabetes prevention based on genetic profiling.",2022,diabetes
36858259,Are Unhealthy Diets Contributing to the Rapid Rise of Type 2 Diabetes in India?,"The prevalence of diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate globally, particularly in India. In the urban areas, the prevalence of diabetes among adults aged ≥20 y, which was around 2% in the early 1970's, has increased by >20% in 50 y. The rapid nutrition transition due to high economic growth rates increased urbanization and globalization has resulted in higher intakes of processed refined grain staples, mainly white rice in Southern and Eastern India and refined wheat in Northern and Western India. This coupled with inadequate quantity and quality of protein; unhealthy fats; lower intake of vegetables, fruits, and fiber; and a sedentary lifestyle are the main drivers of the diabetes epidemic in India. This review attempts to discuss both the quality and quantity of Indian diets with specific reference to macronutrients. This review also outlines some of the strategies that can be employed to slow down the diabetes epidemic in this region.

36525959,Enhancing Capacity for Food and Nutrient Intake Assessment in Population Sciences Research.,"Nutrition influences health throughout the life course. Good nutrition increases the probability of good pregnancy outcomes, proper childhood development, and healthy aging, and it lowers the probability of developing common diet-related chronic diseases, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Despite the importance of diet and health, studying these exposures is among the most challenging in population sciences research. US and global food supplies are complex; eating patterns have shifted such that half of meals are eaten away from home, and there are thousands of food ingredients with myriad combinations. These complexities make dietary assessment and links to health challenging both for population sciences research and for public health policy and practice.

We assessed the association of a composite measure of lifestyle with plasma metabolite profiles and incident type 2 diabetes, and whether relevant metabolites can explain the prospective association between healthy lifestyle and incident type 2 diabetes. A Healthy Lifestyle Score (HLS) (5-point scale including diet, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption and BMI) was estimated in 1016 Hortega Study participants, who had targeted plasma metabolomic determinations at baseline examination in 2001-2003, and were followed-up to 2015 to ascertain incident type 2 diabetes. The HLS was cross-sectionally associated with 32 (out of 49) plasma metabolites (2.5% false discovery rate). In the subset of 830 participants without prevalent type 2 diabetes, the rate ratio (RR) and rate difference (RD) of incident type 2 diabetes (n cases = 51) per one-point increase in HLS was, respectively, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.51, 0.93), and - 8.23 (95% CI, - 16.34, - 0.13)/10,000 person-years. In single-metabolite models, most of the HLS-related metabolites were prospectively associated with incident type 2 diabetes. In probit Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression, these prospective associations were mostly driven by medium HDL particle concentration and phenylpropionate, followed by small LDL particle concentration, which jointly accounted for ~ 50% of the HLS-related decrease in incident type 2 diabetes. The HLS showed a strong inverse association with incident type 2 diabetes, which was largely explained by plasma metabolites measured years before the clinical diagnosis.",2022,diabetes

Unhealthy eating habits and physical inactivity have been linked to the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite dietary recommendations, individuals consume inadequate amounts or unsuitable type of dietary fiber (DF) which needs correction. An Expert group attempted to review and report on the role and importance of high DF in the management of T2DM and offer practical guidance on high fiber use in daily diet. Twelve diabetologists and two expert dietitians from India were chosen to ensure diversity of the members both in professional interest and cultural background. The authors convened virtually for one group meeting and actively participated in a detailed discussion. Multiple reviews of the draft document followed by focused teleconference calls & email helped to reach consensus on final recommendations between Aug 2021 and Dec 2021. Evidence has shown that medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is a valuable approach and an essential component of T2DM prevention and management. Studies have shown that fiber rich diabetes nutrition (FDN) has multi-systemic health benefits, including, improvement in glycemic control, reduction in glucose spikes, decrease in hyperinsulinemia, improvement in plasma lipid concentrations and weight management in T2DM patients. A high fiber diet is vital for people with diabetes and associated conditions. Increasing fiber intake, preferably through food or through dietary supplement, may help.

However, its relationship with macronutrients by eating occasions has not been explored deeply. <b>Objective</b>: Our aim was to estimate the association between chrono-nutrition, sleep quality, chronotype, and the prevalence of T2DM. <b>Methods</b>: This cross-sectional study included a subset of 3465 middle-aged Caucasian adults (2068 women) from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Spain cohort study. In the 2017-18 follow-up, we assessed chronotype, sleep quality, diet, and sociodemographic data using validated questionnaires. Further, we used blood samples to determine serum levels of glucose. We defined a case of T2DM when serum glucose concentration was ≥126 mg/dL or when participants self-reported diabetes. <b>Results</b>: A higher prevalence of T2DM was associated with poor sleep quality (OR<sub>poor<i>vs</i>good</sub> = 2.90, 95% CI = 1.30, 6.28). Carbohydrate intake at breakfast was inversely associated with the prevalence of T2DM (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.66, 0.85). Finally, lipid intake at breakfast was associated with a 13% higher prevalence of T2DM (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.26) for each 1 standard deviation (1-SD) increase. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study concludes that a higher content of carbohydrates at breakfast is correlated with a reduced prevalence of T2DM, while higher lipids intake at breakfast is associated with a higher prevalence of T2DM. Furthermore, poor sleep quality is a potential factor associated with an elevated prevalence of T2DM. Our results emphasize the need for prospective studies to validate and strengthen these observed associations.",2024,diabetes

Articles published between January 2005 and March 2022 were searched in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Scopus. Studies that included KD in lifestyle interventions for adults with T2D and overweight/obesity and measured ketone levels were included. The eleven included studies comprised eight randomized controlled trials. They mainly used self-reported measures to evaluate adherence to the KD and level of PA. We found studies reported higher carbohydrate intake and lower fat intake than the KD regimen. Great inconsistencies were found among studies on the measurement and reporting of ketone and PA levels.

On the other hand, the circadian rhythm is one of the most significant biological pathways in humans and other mammals, which is affected by light, sleep, and human activity. However, this cycle is controlled via complicated cellular pathways with feedback loops. It is widely known that changes in the circadian rhythm can alter some metabolic pathways of body cells and could affect the treatment process, particularly for metabolic diseases like T2DM. The aim of this study is to explore the importance of the circadian rhythm in the occurrence of T2DM via reviewing the metabolic pathways involved, their relationship with the circadian rhythm from two perspectives, lifestyle and molecular pathways, and their effect on T2DM pathophysiology. These impacts have been demonstrated in a variety of studies and led to the development of approaches such as time-restricted feeding, chronotherapy (time-specific therapies), and circadian molecule stabilizers.",2023,diabetes
33231159,Current Evidence Regarding Low-carb Diets for The Metabolic Control of Type-2 Diabetes.,"The management of diabetes requires a medical nutrition therapy as an essential part of this treatment. There should be no ""one-size-fits-all"" eating pattern for different patient´s profiles with diabetes. It is clinically complex to suggest an ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrates, protein and lipids recommended for all patients with diabetes. Among the eating patterns that have shown beneficial effects on metabolic control of patients with type 2 diabetes is the lowcarb diet, since the carbohydrate ingestion is viewed as the most important determinant of postprandial glucose and insulin response. In this context, theoretically, it could make sense to reduce the daily amount of carbohydrates ingested, to achieve lower levels of HbA1c. There could be risks associated to this approach. The adherence to a low-carb diet is here also discussed. This narrative review shows on the current evidence for answering these questions regarding low-carb diet as a possible alternative eating pattern for type 2 diabetes.",2021,diabetes
34818147,Type 2 Diabetes Among Filipino American Adults in the Multiethnic Cohort.,"Several Asian racial and ethnic groups, including individuals of Filipino ancestry, are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than White individuals, despite their lower body mass index (BMI). This study examined determinants of type 2 diabetes among Filipino American adults in the Multiethnic Cohort Study. Participants in Hawaii and Los Angeles completed questionnaires on demographics, diet, and anthropometrics. Generational status was determined according to birthplace of participants and their parents. Based on self-reported data and data on medications, type 2 diabetes status was classified as no, prevalent, or incident. We used polytomous logistic regression, while adjusting for confounders, to obtain odds ratios. Among 10,681 Multiethnic Cohort Study participants reporting any Filipino ancestry, 57% were 1st-, 17% were 2nd-, and 25% were 3rd-generation Filipino Americans. Overall, 13% and 17% of participants had a prevalent or incident type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Overweight and obesity and the presence of other risk factors increased from the 1st to subsequent generations. First-generation immigrants were less likely to report type 2 diabetes at cohort entry than immigrants of subsequent generations who were born in the US or whose parents were born in the US; only the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was significantly elevated in the 2nd generation compared with the 1st generation. The results support the hypothesis that Filipino migrants adopt lifestyle factors of the host country and subsequent generations experience higher type 2 diabetes rates due to changes in risk factor patterns.",2021,diabetes
36797025,Couple-based lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes: protocol for a randomised pilot trial.,"Type 2 diabetes is prevalent among US adults. Lifestyle interventions that modify health behaviours prevent or delay progression to diabetes among individuals at high risk. Despite the well-documented influence of individuals' social context on their health, evidence-based type 2 diabetes prevention interventions do not systematically incorporate participants' romantic partners. Involving partners of individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes in primary prevention may improve engagement and outcomes of programmes. The randomised pilot trial protocol described in this manuscript will evaluate a couple-based lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes. The objective of the trial is to describe the feasibility of the couple-based intervention and the study protocol to guide planning of a definitive randomised clinical trial (RCT). We used community-based participatory research principles to adapt an individual diabetes prevention curriculum for delivery to couples. This parallel two-arm pilot study will include 12 romantic couples in which at least one partner (ie, 'target individual') is at risk for type 2 diabetes. Couples will be randomised to either the 2021 version of the CDC's PreventT2 curriculum designed for delivery to individuals (six couples), or PreventT2 Together, the adapted couple-based curriculum (six couples). Participants and interventionists will be unblinded, but research nurses collecting data will be blinded to treatment allocation. Feasibility of the couple-based intervention and the study protocol will be assessed using both quantitative and qualitative measures. This study has been approved by the University of Utah IRB (#143079). Findings will be shared with researchers through publications and presentations. We will collaborate with community partners to determine the optimal strategy for communicating findings to community members. Results will inform a subsequent definitive RCT.

36558484,Revised Protein Sparing Diet in Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Effective nutrition therapy is a pressing issue in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management. As such, this research aimed to determine the performance of a revised dietary strategy built on the protein-sparing diet in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus with regard to obtaining a rapid and stable improvement in glucometabolic control, body weight, body composition, and energy metabolism when applying the strategy in just twenty-one days. The revised protein-sparing diet differs from the traditional protein-sparing modified fast (PSMF) because it does not include foods. The daily calorie intake of this diet is exclusively derived from Isolate whey protein in addition to a formulation of Isolate whey protein enriched with essential amino acids in free form, with the addition of lipids such as extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil as a source of medium chain fatty acids, where the latter is taken for only the first four days of the diet, together with the use, for the same duration, of extended-release metformin, as the only antihyperglycemic allowed. Anthropometric measurements, bioimpedance analysis, indirect calorimetry, and blood chemistry assessments were conducted at the beginning of the study, time 0 (T0), and at the end, time 1 (T1), i.e., on the 21st day. The main outcomes of the revised protein-sparing diet after only twenty-one days were a reduction in body weight with the predominant loss of visceral atherogenic abdominal fat and, therefore, a possible contextual reduction in ectopic fat deposits together with a simultaneous reduction in insulin resistance and normalization of insulin levels, maintenance of free fat mass and basal metabolism, restoration of metabolic flexibility, and improvement of the glucometabolic and lipidic parameters. These results demonstrate the promising potential of the revised protein-sparing diet as an ""etiologic tool"" in the integrated nutritional treatment of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.",2022,diabetes
34719409,Lower carbohydrate diets for adults with type 2 diabetes.,"In May 2021, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) published a risk assessment on lower carbohydrate diets for adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D)<sup>()</sup>. The purpose of the report was to review the evidence on 'low'-carbohydrate diets compared with the current UK government advice on carbohydrate intake for adults with T2D. However, since there is no agreed and widely utilised definition of a 'low'-carbohydrate diet, comparisons in the report were between lower and higher carbohydrate diets. SACN's remit is to assess the risks and benefits of nutrients, dietary patterns, food or food components for health by evaluating scientific evidence and to make dietary recommendations for the UK based on its assessment<sup>()</sup>. SACN has a public health focus and only considers evidence in healthy populations unless specifically requested to do otherwise. Since the Committee does not usually make recommendations relating to clinical conditions, a joint working group (WG) was established in 2017 to consider this issue. The WG comprised members of SACN and members nominated by Diabetes UK, the British Dietetic Association, Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of General Practitioners. Representatives from NHS England and NHS Health Improvement, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and devolved health departments were also invited to observe the WG.

Large prospective cohort studies show an association between regular consumption of nuts (>= 140 g per week) and a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. In randomized controlled trials, strong evidence has been obtained that consuming nuts lowers blood cholesterol and improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Recent epidemiological studies show that high nut consumption does not increase body weight; rather, the inclusion of nuts in the hypocaloric diet can help to control or reduce body weight and waist circumference. A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies shows that nut consumption is associated with a reduced risk of death from all causes and from chronic diseases. ""Nut snack"" is a good strategy to avoid weight gain and improve chemical composition of the diet. <b>Conclusion</b>. Adequate replacement of some foods in the diet with nuts does not cause body weight increase and helps to prevent a number of diseases.",2020,diabetes
34743575,Trained Volunteers With Type 2 Diabetes Experience Significant Health Benefits When Providing Peer Support.,"Trained lay volunteers may have value in supporting lifestyle change programs in the prevention of type 2 diabetes, but the potential health benefits (or harms) experienced by these lay volunteers have not been well described. This is important, as this is an appealing model in terms of workforce planning. The aim of the prespecified quantitative study reported here, was to examine the possible health benefits or harms experienced by these trained lay volunteers with type 2 diabetes. In a large type 2 diabetes prevention program, we recruited and trained 104 lay volunteers with type 2 diabetes themselves, to act as diabetes prevention mentors and codeliver the lifestyle intervention. Mentors made motivational telephone calls to 461 participants randomized to one of the trial arms to encourage lifestyle changes. Weight, diet, physical activity, well-being, quality of life, diabetes-specific self-efficacy, and glycaemic control were measured at baseline, 12 and 24 months. Average mentor age was 62.0 years, 57 (54.8%) were male, 92 (88.5%) were overweight or obese (BMI>30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). At 12 months, mentor dietary behaviors (fat and fiber intake) improved significantly, sedentary time spent fell significantly, and diabetes specific self-efficacy scores significantly increased. These significant improvements, with no evidence of harms, suggest lay volunteers with type 2 diabetes codelivering a lifestyle intervention, may themselves experience health benefits from volunteering.",2022,diabetes
33297687,Medical nutrition therapy of obesity and its metabolic complications.,"Diet therapy of obesity and its metabolic complications is focused on the reversal of chronic positive energy balance, systemic inflammation and adipose tissue dysfunction. The priority in the treatment is caloric restriction together with increased nutritional quality, prevention of nutritional deficits, care of intestinal microbioma, reduction of the organism&#39;s exposure to contaminants and increase of the protective components in the diet. The recommended daily energy dose ranges from very low-calorie diets (1.5 to 3 MJ) to low-calorie diets (5 to 7 MJ). According to common EASD and ADA guidelines, the following energy-restricted types of diets are recommended in the management and prevention of metabolic complications of obesity in the form of type 2 diabetes mellitus: Mediterranean, DASH, low-carbohydrate, and vegetarian style of diet.

38892604,Plant-Based Food for the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes: Scoping Review.,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic condition with growing worldwide prevalence. Besides genetic factors, a sedentary lifestyle, excess weight, and inadequate eating habits, characterized by an excess intake of refined carbohydrates and ultra-processed foods, are contributing factors for the development of the disease. In this scenario, promoting a plant-based diet, and limiting animal product consumption while increasing the intake of vegetables, concurrently with healthy lifestyle habits, is a promising strategy to prevent T2DM. This scoping review, carried out between 2017 and 2022, aimed to gather evidence substantiating the benefits of a plant-based diet in T2DM prevention, considering different eating patterns, such as vegetarian, vegan, Mediterranean, and DASH diets. Several studies demonstrate a significant reduction in T2DM incidence among individuals adopting plant-based eating patterns or emphasizing healthy plant-based food alongside decreased intake or exclusion of animal-based foods. There are still no robust data regarding plant-based diets and the prevention of diabetes without loss in body weight. Hence, prospective studies in plant-based diets with weight control are needed. Nevertheless, adopting plant-based diets appears to induce significant weight loss, which is crucial in an obesity-endemic context. Thus, embracing plant-based diets, along with healthy habits, emerges as a relevant strategy in obesity and T2DM prevention.",2024,diabetes
34802979,Effects of common weight loss plans on diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular risk factors.,"Diabetes mellitus is globally considered one of the most common chronic diseases, management of which is critically asscociated with an adequate dietary approach. With overweight and obesity being a global epidemic, choosing the appropriate weight loss plan for patients with diabetes seems to be of particular concern for healthcare professionals. Since diabetes and cardiovascular diseases frequently coexist, modern pharmacological therapeutic models aim at addressing both. Therapeutic targets in diabetic population that address glycemic control, adequate lipid and blood pressure control proves to limit the incidence of cardiovascular events, reduce the risk of chronic complications and improve patients quality of life. Similarly, dietary managment in this population should also concentrate on the reduction of reversible cardiovascular risk factors. Nutritional recommendations for diabetic patients should be individualized to meet their expectations and lifestyle in order to ensure compliance and long-term effects. As diabetic population is more vulnerable to further health risks associated with diet induced metabolic changes, inadequate intake of dietary components and increased cardiovascular risk, nutrition plans should be addressed more carefully in this group.",2022,diabetes

39796606,Role of Medical Nutrition Therapy as Treatment of Sarcopenia in Older People with Type 2 Diabetes.,"Globally, the progressive increase in the aging population has led to social and health problems associated with age-related chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and sarcopenia. Recent studies have highlighted that sarcopenia and diabetes have a bidirectional relationship. Nutritional therapy is a key element in the treatment of both sarcopenia and diabetes. To date, there are no nutritional guidelines for the management of sarcopenia in T2DM. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a muscle-targeted nutritional intervention in older people with sarcopenia and type 2 diabetes based on the Italian nutrition guidelines. A total of 211 subjects (117 M and 94 F) affected by T2DM with a mean age of 74 ± 6.0 years were screened for sarcopenia, using EWGSOP2 diagnosis criteria, and enrolled to receive personalized dietary plans with two main targets: a daily energy intake of 25-30 kcal/kg body weight and a daily protein intake of at least 1.1-1.2 g/kg body weight. In total, 34 subjects (24 M and 10 F) were sarcopenic with a prevalence of 16%, which was higher in men. After six months of treatment, handgrip strength increased by 0.83 kg (19.57 ± 5.70 kg vs. 20.40 ± 6.10 kg, <i>p</i> = 0.649), protein intake improved (0.91 ± 0.28 g/kg body weight vs. 1.03 ± 0.40 g/kg body weight, <i>p</i> = 0.115), and the glycated hemoglobin decreased (7.39 ± 0.49% to 6.82 ± 0.98%, <i>p</i> = 0.010). Seven younger subjects had an improvement of sarcopenia with a decrease in HbA1c (7.50 ± 0.59% vs. 6.91 ± 0.79, <i>p</i> = 0.19). The difference over time in the consumption of saturated fatty acids (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.33-1.09, <i>p</i> = 0.096) and simple sugars (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80-1.01, <i>p</i> = 0.090) appeared to be associated with an improvement of sarcopenia status. A total of 177 subjects did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of sarcopenia, and 148 subjects were assessed. The handgrip strength (26.22 ± 9.36 vs. 26.18 ± 9.24 kg, p0.974) and the glycated hemoglobin (7.21 ± 1.07 vs. 7.27 ± 0.98%, <i>p</i> = 0.735) remained stable over time, while protein intake at six months increased (0.81 ± 0.29 vs. 0.91 ± 0.29 g/kg body weight, <i>p</i> = 0.024). Four people were diagnosed with sarcopenia at follow-up, with a lower handgrip strength test result. These subjects were older and had worse glycemic control (HbA1c + 0.5%). Lifestyle modification is important to prevent or reverse the development of the disease. Nutritional therapy in this population is therefore aimed at meeting all nutritional needs and promoting better glycemic control, in terms of glycated hemoglobin, in order to reduce the development of sarcopenia. Although promising, the intervention requires validation in larger studies with control groups.",2025,diabetes
37839954,Nutrigenomics and redox regulation: Concepts relating to the Special Issue on nutrigenomics.,"During our whole lifespan, from conception to death, the epigenomes of all tissues and cell types of our body integrate signals from the environment. This includes signals derived from our diet and the uptake of macro- and micronutrients. In most cases, this leads only to transient changes, but some effects of this epigenome programming process are persistent and can even be transferred to the next generation. Both epigenetic programming and redox processes are affected by the individual choice of diet and other lifestyle decisions like physical activity. The nutrient-gene communication pathways have adapted during human evolution and are essential for maintaining health. However, when they are maladaptive, such as in long-term obesity, they significantly contribute to diseases like type 2 diabetes and cancer. The field of nutrigenomics investigates nutrition-related signal transduction pathways and their effect on gene expression involving interactions both with the genome and the epigenomes. Several of these diet-(epi)genome interactions and the involved signal transduction cascades are redox-regulated. Examples include the effects of the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, vitamin C levels and secondary metabolites of dietary molecules from plants on the acetylation and methylation state of the epigenome as well as on gene expression through redox-sensitive pathways via the transcription factors NFE2L2 and FOXO. In this review, we summarize and extend on these topics as well as those discussed in the articles of this Special Issue and take them into the context of redox biology.",2023,diabetes

A Qualitative Study of Patient Perceptions and Treatment Preferences.","The purpose of the study was to explore the thoughts, feelings, motivations, and assignment preferences of community health center patients with type 2 diabetes considering participation in a 2-year lifestyle intervention trial aimed at weight loss and increased physical activity. The reasons for patients' delivery mode preferences were also explored to aid in the design of future interventions for controlled trials. Using structured telephone interview guides, 57 patients with type 2 diabetes receiving primary care at 3 community health centers affiliated with an academic medical center were interviewed regarding the perceived pros and cons of each of the 3 possible treatment assignments: telephone conference group, in-person group, or individual medical nutrition therapy. The interview data were organized using NVIVO and analyzed using content analysis. Findings on whether preferences varied by age, gender, or diabetes duration were also examined. Six categories related to patient treatment preferences were identified: (1) perception of time, (2) learning style, (3) comfort, (4) prior experience with weight loss programs and conference calls, (5) desire for support/idea exchange, and (6) accountability. Preferences did not seem to vary by age, gender, or diabetes duration. Key factors influencing preference of treatment assignment included schedule demands, belief about learning style, and past experiences. These findings demonstrate the importance of having a variety of nutrition and lifestyle treatment options available to meet the needs of people with type 2 diabetes.",2024,diabetes
38613048,Visceral Adipose Tissue: The Hidden Culprit for Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance in various tissues. Though conventionally associated with obesity, current research indicates that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is the leading determining factor, wielding more influence regardless of individual body mass. The heightened metabolic activity of VAT encourages the circulation of free fatty acid (FFA) molecules, which induce insulin resistance in surrounding tissues. Individuals most vulnerable to this preferential fat deposition are older males with ancestral ties to Asian countries because genetics and sex hormones are pivotal factors for VAT accumulation. However, interventions in one's diet and lifestyle have the potential to strategically discourage the growth of VAT. This illuminates the possibility that the expansion of VAT and, subsequently, the risk of T2D development are preventable. Therefore, by reducing the amount of VAT accumulated in an individual and preventing it from building up, one can effectively control and prevent the development of T2D.",2024,diabetes
33503923,Genetically Guided Mediterranean Diet for the Personalized Nutritional Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"The current consensus for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is that high-quality diets and adherence to a healthy lifestyle provide significant health benefits. Remarkably, however, there is little agreement on the proportions of macronutrients in the diet that should be recommended to people suffering from pre-diabetes or T2DM. We herein discuss emerging evidence that underscores the importance of gene-diet interactions in the improvement of glycemic biomarkers in T2DM. We propose that we can achieve better glycemic control in T2DM patients by coupling Mediterranean diets to genetic information as a predictor for optimal diet macronutrient composition in a personalized manner. We provide evidence to support this concept by presenting a case study of a T2DM patient who achieved rapid glycemic control when adhered to a personalized, genetically-guided Mediterranean Diet.",2021,diabetes
35210134,"Lifestyle behaviors and cardiovascular risk profiles among parous women by gestational diabetes status, 2007-2018.","Women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at elevated risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. We compared cardiometabolic risk factors among parous U.S. women ages 20-44 by history of GDM. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007 to 2018, 3537 parous women were classified by self-reported GDM history. We compared anthropometric measures, glycemia, blood pressure, lipids, lifestyle factors, cardiovascular health, and cardiometabolic disease prevalence by GDM status. NHANES survey design was taken into account. Women without history of GDM were younger and, after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and education, had more favorable cardiometabolic risk factor profiles for measures of anthropometry, glycemia, diabetes, many lipids, physical activity, diet, and overall cardiovascular health than women with history of GDM. Many patterns persisted after further adjustment for lifestyle factors. In analyses stratified by race/ethnicity, many patterns persisted, though there were key differences. Hypertension prevalence differed by GDM history only among Hispanic women. In women of other race/ethnicity, there was no difference in healthy eating or body mass index by GDM history. In non-Hispanic Black women, there was no difference in healthy eating by GDM history. Among parous U.S. women ages 20-44, those with history of GDM had less favorable cardiometabolic risk factor profiles than those without history of GDM. This highlights the importance of continued efforts to develop and test multilevel interventions to improve cardiometabolic risk factors among reproductive-age women with a history of GDM.",2022,diabetes
37432247,"Polygenic Risk Score, Lifestyles, and Type 2 Diabetes Risk: A Prospective Chinese Cohort Study.","The aim of this study was to generate a polygenic risk score (PRS) for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and test whether it could be used in identifying high-risk individuals for lifestyle intervention in a Chinese cohort. We genotyped 80 genetic variants among 5024 participants without non-communicable diseases at baseline in the Wuxi Non-Communicable Diseases cohort (Wuxi NCDs cohort). During the follow-up period of 14 years, 440 cases of T2D were newly diagnosed. Using Cox regression, we found that the PRS of 46 SNPs identified by the East Asians was relevant to the future T2D. Participants with a high PRS (top quintile) had a two-fold higher risk of T2D than the bottom quintile (hazard ratio: 2.06, 95% confidence interval: 1.42-2.97). Lifestyle factors were considered, including cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, physical exercise, diet, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC). Among high-PRS individuals, the 10-year incidence of T2D slumped from 6.77% to 3.28% for participants having ideal lifestyles (4-6 healthy lifestyle factors) compared with poor lifestyles (0-2 healthy lifestyle factors). When integrating the high PRS, the 10-year T2D risk of low-clinical-risk individuals exceeded that of high-clinical-risk individuals with a low PRS (3.34% vs. 2.91%). These findings suggest that the PRS of 46 SNPs could be used in identifying high-risk individuals and improve the risk stratification defined by traditional clinical risk factors for T2D. Healthy lifestyles can reduce the risk of a high PRS, which indicates the potential utility in early screening and precise prevention.",2023,diabetes

This study systematically assesses the published evidence about childhood modifiable risk factors and adulthood CKD. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science to 6<sup>th</sup> May 2022. Articles were included if (1) they were population-based longitudinal studies, (2) exposures were potentially modifiable, for example through pharmacological or lifestyle modifications, including clinical conditions/measures (diabetes, blood pressure, adiposity, and dyslipidaemia); health behaviours (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, fitness, and poor nutrition); and socio-economic factors (socio-economic position), and occurred during childhood (ages 2-19 years), and (3) outcome was CKD or surrogate markers of CKD in adulthood (ages 20 years or older). Three reviewers independently extracted the data. 15,232 articles were identified after deduplication; 17 articles met the inclusion criteria, reporting childhood blood pressure (n = 8), adiposity (n = 4), type 2 diabetes (n = 1), socio-economic position (n = 1), famine (n = 1), cardiorespiratory fitness (n = 1), and a healthy lifestyle score (n = 1). The results suggested positive associations of childhood adiposity, type 2 diabetes, and low socio-economic position and cardiorespiratory fitness in females with CKD in adulthood. Findings were inconsistent on associations between childhood BP and CKD in adulthood. Childhood healthy lifestyle score and exposure to famine were not associated with risk of CKD in adulthood. The limited evidence suggests childhood factors may contribute to the CKD risk in adulthood, particularly adiposity, type 2 diabetes, and low socio-economic position and cardiorespiratory fitness in females. Further high-quality community-based studies are needed with long-term follow-up and investigation of a broader range of modifiable risk factors.",2023,diabetes

A total of 5,542 participants were recruited into 11 studies (eight randomized controlled trials [n = 5,346] and three observational studies [n = 196]). The sample size ranged 6-4,678 participants, the mean age was 51.7-60.0 years and diabetes duration was 2.1-19.2 years, with high heterogeneity between studies. Overall, the available evidence showed, compared with traditional self-monitoring of blood glucose levels, CGM promoted greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin, bodyweight and caloric intake; higher adherence rating to a personal eating plan; and increases in physical activity. High compliance to CGM wear-time and device calibration was reported (>90%). The addition of lifestyle and/or behavioral counseling to CGM appeared to further potentiate these improvements. Preliminary evidence suggests that CGM use promotes glycemic and weight control, and lifestyle behavior adherence in adults with type 2 diabetes. These benefits might be further enhanced with integration of diet, exercise, and glucose excursion education and counseling. However, specific attributes of effective interventions and the application of CGM information for promoting improved outcomes and healthier choices remain unclear.",2018,diabetes
40428400,Gene-Diet Interactions in Diabetes Mellitus: Current Insights and the Potential of Personalized Nutrition.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remaina significant global health challenge, with its increasing prevalence and associated complications contributing to high morbidity and economic burden. Genetic factors play a crucial role in T2DM susceptibility, yet individual responses to dietary interventions vary widely, emphasizing the importance of gene-diet (G × D) interactions. This review synthesizes the current literature on the genetic basis of T2DM and the role of G × D interactions in shaping individual responses to diet. We examine the genetics implication in T2DM risk and modulation by dietary factors, with a focus on the potential of Nutrigenetics in guiding personalized nutrition (PN) strategies. Moreover, the clinical implications of these interactions for the personalized prevention and management of T2DM are explored, highlighting the promise of tailoring dietary recommendations based on genetic profiles. Critical research gaps, including the need for diverse and longitudinal studies, the integration of multi-omic data, and the inclusion of digital health technologies in PN are discussed. Finally, future directions for the field are outlined, advocating for more inclusive, large-scale studies to optimize PN approaches for diverse populations and improve the efficacy of T2DM prevention and management. This review underscores the potential of an individualized, genetically informed dietary approach in modulating the global burden of T2DM.",2025,diabetes
33313032,Development of a Yoga Program for Type-2 Diabetes Prevention (YOGA-DP) Among High-Risk People in India.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Many Indians are at high-risk of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Yoga is an ancient Indian mind-body discipline, that has been associated with improved glucose levels and can help to prevent T2DM. The study aimed to systematically develop a Yoga program for T2DM prevention (YOGA-DP) among high-risk people in India using a complex intervention development approach. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> As part of the intervention, we developed a booklet and a high-definition video for participants and a manual for YOGA-DP instructors. A systematic iterative process was followed to develop the intervention and included five steps: (i) a systematic review of the literature to generate a list of Yogic practices that improves blood glucose levels among adults at high-risk of or with T2DM, (ii) validation of identified Yogic practices by Yoga experts, (iii) development of the intervention, (iv) consultation with Yoga, exercise, physical activity, diet, behavior change, and/or diabetes experts about the intervention, and (v) pretest the intervention among Yoga practitioners and lay people (those at risk of T2DM and had not practiced Yoga before) in India. <b>Results:</b> YOGA-DP is a structured lifestyle education and exercise program, provided over a period of 24 weeks. The exercise part is based on Yoga and includes Shithilikarana Vyayama (loosening exercises), Surya Namaskar (sun salutation exercises), Asana (Yogic poses), Pranayama (breathing practices), and Dhyana (meditation) and relaxation practices. Once participants complete the program, they are strongly encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle in the long-term. <b>Conclusions:</b> We systematically developed a novel Yoga program for T2DM prevention (YOGA-DP) among high-risk people in India. A multi-center feasibility randomized controlled trial is in progress in India.",2020,diabetes

25416725,Mechanisms in endocrinology: Gut microbiota in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Perturbations of the composition and function of the gut microbiota have been associated with metabolic disorders including obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Studies on mice have demonstrated several underlying mechanisms including host signalling through bacterial lipopolysaccharides derived from the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, bacterial fermentation of dietary fibres to short-chain fatty acids and bacterial modulation of bile acids. On top of this, an increased permeability of the intestinal epithelium may lead to increased absorption of macromolecules from the intestinal content resulting in systemic immune responses, low-grade inflammation and altered signalling pathways influencing lipid and glucose metabolism. While mechanistic studies on mice collectively support a causal role of the gut microbiota in metabolic diseases, the majority of studies in humans are correlative of nature and thus hinder causal inferences. Importantly, several factors known to influence the risk of type 2 diabetes, e.g. diet and age, have also been linked to alterations in the gut microbiota complicating the interpretation of correlative studies. However, based upon the available evidence, it is hypothesised that the gut microbiota may mediate or modulate the influence of lifestyle factors triggering development of type 2 diabetes. Thus, the aim of this review is to critically discuss the potential role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.",2015,diabetes
33280180,Cost effectiveness of dietitian-led nutrition therapy for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a scoping review.,"The management of diabetes costs in excess of $1.3 trillion per annum worldwide. Diet is central to the management of type 2 diabetes. It is not known whether dietetic intervention is cost effective. This scoping review aimed to map the existing literature concerning the cost effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy provided by dietitians for people with type 2 diabetes. Thirteen scientific databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, as well as multiple official websites, were searched to source peer-reviewed articles, reports, guidelines, dissertations and other grey literature published from 2008 to present. Eligible articles had to have assessed and reported the cost effectiveness of dietetic intervention for adults with type 2 diabetes in developed countries. Experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and qualitative studies were considered. Of 2387 abstracts assessed for eligibility, four studies combining 22 765 adults with type 2 diabetes were included. Dietetic intervention was shown to be cost-effective in terms of diabetes-related healthcare costs and hospital charges, at the same time as also reducing the risk of cumulative days at work lost to less than half and the risk of disability 'sick' days at work to less than one-seventh. The findings highlight the importance of advocacy for medical nutrition therapy for people with type 2 diabetes, with respect to alleviating the great global economic burden from this condition. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the factors that mediate and moderate cost effectiveness and to allow for the generalisation of the findings.",2021,diabetes
33894117,Effect of Calorie Restriction and Exercise on Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic condition, generally regarded as an irreversible, that is among the top 10 causes of death globally. The hallmark of T2D is hyperglycemia, which results from disturbances in insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Several clinical and lifestyle factors are involved in the progression of T2D, such as obesity and physical inactivity. A high-calorie diet is the main contributor to the development of obesity, which results in T2D, as obesity or increased intra-abdominal adipose tissue is related to insulin resistance. Technological advances have contributed to individuals having a more sedentary lifestyle, leading to obesity and T2D. T2D can be treated with lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise. Herein, we highlight the positive impact of a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) and lifestyle modalities in the treatment and prevention of T2D. An inclusion of VLCD 400-800 kcal/day for 8 weeks and ≥ 150 minutes exercise 5 times a week as lifestyle interventions can decrease glucose levels to normal, reduce HbA1c and improve insulin resistance and sensitivity. Therefore, a potential mechanism in maintaining glucose homeostasis and remission of T2D by VLCD and exercise reduces body weight.",2021,diabetes
26655787,Efficacy of lifestyle interventions in patients with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The current meta-analysis evaluated the outcomes of various lifestyle interventions, including diet modifications (DIET), physical activity (PA), and patient education (EDU) in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. Randomized clinical trials comparing lifestyle intervention with ""usual care"" (control) in type 2 diabetes patients were hand-searched from medical databases by two independent reviewers using the terms ""diabetes, cardiovascular risk, lifestyle, health education, dietary, exercise/physical activities, and behavior intervention"". Of the 235 studies identified, 17 were chosen for the meta-analysis. The average age of patients ranged from 50-67.3 years. Results reveal no significant difference between the groups, with respect to BMI, while PA and DIET yielded a greater reduction in HbA1c. Significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressures in the DIET group, and diastolic pressure in the PA group, was observed. HDL-c in the DIET group was significantly higher than the control group, while no change in LDL-c levels, was seen in all three intervention subtypes. There was no difference between the EDU vs. the control group in terms of HbA1c, blood pressure or HDL-c and LDL-c. DIET intervention showed an improvement in HbA1c, systolic/diastolic blood pressure and HDL-c, with an exception of LDL-c and BMI, suggesting that nutritional intervention had a significant impact on the quality of life by reducing the cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes patients.",2016,diabetes
34032395,The Role of Vegan Diets in Lipotoxicity-induced Beta-cell Dysfunction in Type-2-Diabetes: A Narrative Review.,"Type-2-diabetes is considered the new plague of the current century and its incidence and prevalence are rapidly increasing. Chronic insulin resistance and a progressive decline in beta-cell function are discussed as the root causes of type-2-diabetes. Both are associated with obesity and prolonged exposure to pathologically elevated concentrations of circulating free fatty acid (FFA) levels in the blood. Fatty acid derivatives may interfere with beta-cell function and ultimately lead to their death through lipoapoptosis. The harmful effects of chronically elevated FFA levels on glucose homeostasis and non-adipose tissues are generally referred to as lipotoxicity. Pancreatic beta-cells appear to be particularly vulnerable, and both dietary fat quantity and quality may impact their function. Diets high in saturated fat are especially harmful to beta-cells while (poly-)unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are associated with beta-cell protective effects. Therefore, this narrative review suggests that a dietary modification toward a low-fat vegan diet might help to prevent or reduce lipotoxicity-induced beta-cell dysfunction. By cutting the oversupply of saturated fat and reducing total calorie intake, and by improving both body weight and glycemic control, low-fat vegan diets may reduce the likelihood of lipotoxic events to occur. In light of the accumulating evidence that lipotoxic events are tightly coupled to excess glucose levels, improved glycemic parameters appear to be of utmost importance. These mechanisms are likely to contribute complementarily to improved beta-cell function in individuals with type-2-diabetes who choose a low-fat vegan diet. Physicians must consider these findings when counseling patients on lifestyle modifications and healthy nutrition.",2020,diabetes
38527395,Relationship of microvascular complications and healthy lifestyle with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in women compared with men with type 2 diabetes.,"Sex differences exist in the prevalence of microvascular disease (MVD) and healthy-lifestyle adherence. Whether MVD and healthy lifestyles are associated with mortality risk similarly for women and men who have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unknown. The present study included 9992 women and 15,860 men with T2DM from the UK Biobank. MVDs included retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and chronic kidney disease. Healthy lifestyle factors consisted of ideal BMI, nonsmoking, healthy diet, regular exercise, and appropriate sleep duration. Sex-specific hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality associated with the MVDs or healthy lifestyles were calculated and women-to-men ratio of HRs (RHR) were further estimated, after multivariable adjustment for potential confounders. During a median of 12.7 years of follow-up, 4346 (1202 in women) all-cause and 1207 (254 in women) CVD deaths were recorded. The adjusted HRs (95% CI) of all-cause mortality for 1 additional increment of the MVDs were 1.71 (1.55, 1.88) for women and 1.48 (1.39, 1.57) for men, with an RHR of 1.16 (1.03, 1.30). The corresponding RHR was 1.36 (1.09, 1.69) for cardiovascular mortality. Adhering to a healthy lifestyle (≥4 vs. ≤1 lifestyle factor) was associated with an approximately 60%-70% lower risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality without sex differences (P-interaction >0.70). Furthermore, as compared with having no MVD and an unfavorable lifestyle, having ≥2 MVDs but a favorable lifestyle was not associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality either in women (HR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.60) or in men (HR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.40), similarly when considering cardiovascular mortality. In T2DM, while MVDs are more strongly associated with mortality risk in women than in men, adhering to a favorable lifestyle is associated with a substantially lower risk of mortality and may eliminate the detrimental impact of MVDs in both sexes.",2024,diabetes

The current prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Egyptians aged 20 to 79 is approximately 15.6%. The objective of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is to optimize the management of the ""ABC"" for diabetes control, glycated hemoglobin, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Our study aimed to assess the effect of MNT on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes attending the family practice clinic. a quasi-experimental intervention trial was conducted with 40 diabetic patients seeking medical service in the Suez Canal University Hospital family practice clinic. The participants were over 20 years old and had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Patients were surveyed using El-Gilany questionnaire to evaluate the socio-demographic traits, physical examination data, and laboratory investigations at baseline and after 12 weeks. medical nutrition therapy (MNT) significantly reduced glycated hemoglobin level (p<0.001); the median level of glycated hemoglobin was 10% with a minimum level of 7.5% vs. a maximum of 14% in the pre-intervention phase. In comparison, the median glycated hemoglobin level was 9.5%, with a minimum level of 5.6% vs. a maximum of 13.5% in the post-intervention phase. In addition, there was a significant improvement in blood pressure, weight, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, and lipid profile. <b>Conclusion:</b> there is evidence that MNT is a crucial component of type 2 diabetes therapy.",2023,diabetes
37994806,Habit Formation Intervention to Improve Type 2 Diabetes Self-Management Behaviors: A Feasibility Study.,"Self-management of lifestyle behaviors is the recommended focus for interventions to address Type 2 diabetes. Habit formation is an effective approach to changing personal behaviors, but evidence of success for Type 2 diabetes is limited. To examine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of occupation-based habit formation interventions for improving diabetes self-management behaviors. Single-subject design with multiple participants providing 4 wk of baseline data followed by 10 wk of intervention data. Individual telehealth sessions. Eight adults (ages 29-75 yr) with Type 2 diabetes, who had access to a telephone and who were not involved in other diabetes-related education or interventions voluntarily, enrolled into the study. Participants engaged in 10 wk of habit formation intervention focused on four diabetes self-management domains: nutrition, blood glucose monitoring, medication management, and physical activity. Data gathered included findings on measures of diabetes self-care behaviors and habit formation. There was a significant change in self-care behaviors for 6 of the 8 participants (p < .05 for 1 participant, and p < .01 for 5 participants). Group changes were statistically significant (p < .001). Habit strength significantly improved for all areas of diabetes self-management (p < .001 for nutrition, blood glucose monitoring, and medication management and p = .001 for physical activity). Findings suggest that the occupation-based intervention was feasible and showed promise for developing self-management behaviors. What This Article Adds: Habits are considered foundational to occupations, yet application of the science of habit formation is often not well understood by occupational therapists. This study considered the theoretical components of habit formation that have been neglected by prior studies and demonstrates the feasibility and preliminary effect estimates of a habit formation intervention when used with people with Type 2 diabetes.",2023,diabetes
38767826,Dietary Modulations in Preventing Cardiometabolic Risk in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex health issue include obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and chronic inflammation that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). CVDs are of great concern in the disease progression and prognosis of T2DM. This review is a comprehensive examination of the literature on the relationship between T2DM and cardiovascular risk, nutrition-related cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors, and impact of dietary modulations on CMR. In recent years the researches has been focus on the importance of a comprehensive treatment approach like dietary modulations to address multiple cardiovascular risk reductions, including hypertension and dyslipidemia. Modulation of dietary patterns are the most promising interventions to prevent CMR factors and T2DM via affecting the body weight, glucose control, and microbial diversity of individuals. Current evidence suggests that high-quality dietary patterns such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan and the Mediterranean diet is important in the metabolic control processes of T2DM with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds, glucagon-like peptide agonist compounds, and intestinal microbiota changes. Nutrition plays a critical role in preventing and improving CVD outcomes in patients with T2DM. Dietary modulations should be planned considering individual differences in responses to dietary composition and nutritional changes, personal preferences, eating behaviors and gut microbiota differences.",2024,diabetes
38409502,"Associations of a proinflammatory diet, habitual salt intake, and the onset of type 2 diabetes: A prospective cohort study from the UK Biobank.","To explore the relationship between proinflammatory diet, habitual salt intake and the onset of type 2 diabetes. This prospective study was conducted among 171 094 UK Biobank participants who completed at least one 24-h dietary questionnaire and were free of diabetes at baseline. Participants were followed up until 1 March 2023 for type 2 diabetes incidence, with diagnosis information obtained from linked medical records. An Energy-adjusted Diet Inflammatory Index (E-DII) was calculated based on 28 food parameters. Habitual salt intake was determined through the self-reported frequency of adding salt to foods. The associations between E-DII, habitual salt intake and type 2 diabetes incidence were tested by the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Over a median follow-up period of 13.5 years, 6216 cases of type 2 diabetes were documented. Compared with participants with a low E-DII (indicative of an anti-inflammatory diet), participants with a high E-DII (indicative of a proinflammatory diet) had an 18% heightened risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The association between E-DII and type 2 diabetes tends to be linear after adjustment for major confounders. Participants with a proinflammatory diet and always adding salt to foods had the highest risk of type 2 diabetes incidence (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.32-1.94). Our findings indicate that a proinflammatory diet and higher habitual salt intake were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. These results support the public health promotion of an anti-inflammatory diet and reducing salt intake to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes.",2024,diabetes
40066570,Evaluation of adherence to the Mediterranean diet after a nutritional dietary intervention from primary care.,"Introduction: currently there are changes in lifestyle that have been modifying the nutritional culture, moving away from the Mediterranean diet (DMed) and acquiring a more sedentary lifestyle, a fact that has contributed to a significant increase in risk factors. (CVRF) such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and consequently to a global increase in metabolic syndrome (MS) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which in the 21st century reinforces being the first cause of morbidity and mortality To reduce this pandemic, a multidisciplinary approach is required focused on the application of primary and secondary prevention strategies for modifiable CVRFs, focused on nutritional promotion and education through the promotion of a healthier lifestyle and diet from childhood, as the one that encompasses the MedD. This dietary pattern, together with physical exercise, has been shown to contribute to the primary and secondary prevention of DM2 and coexisting CVRF. Objective: to determine the initial adherence to the DMed in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and to analyze the effects of a nutritional educational intervention from Primary Care on glycemic control and the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet post-intervention and their relationship. Material and methods: descriptive observational study and quasi-experimental analytical study (before-after) in 93 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus with poor glycemic control (A1c ≥ 7 %), carried out in various health centers in Albacete and Cuenca between 2018 and 2019, in which the relationship between adherence to MedDM and CVRF is evaluated, before and after an educational intervention on MedDM. They are administered a data collection sheet that includes a MedD adherence survey (MEDAS-14) at baseline and at 6 months, after completing an education on MedD in Primary Care (PC) medical and nursing consultations). The pre- and post-intervention variables were analyzed: age groups, sex, years of evolution of DM2, body mass index (BMI), as well as basal glycemia (GB) and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c). The main variable ""MEDAS-14"" is related to the rest of the variables. Results: both poor glycemic control and having a high BMI are related to low adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Pre-intervention the score of the survey of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was relatively low (7.44 ± 0.22 points), being in women (7.66 points) than in men (7.1 points). Despite the high consumption of olive oil, a large number of processed products are consumed (sweetened beverages, butter, commercial confectionery), with a low consumption of fruit, fish and nuts. The high levels of basal glycemia are also related to the low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (p < 0.04), as well as the increase in glycosylated hemoglobin (p < 0.06). Post-intervention, adherence to the DMED increased by 1.09 ± 2.56 points (8.55 points). Men being those who present 0.4 points more (8.7 points) than women (8.4 points). The biggest changes have been in relation to the increase in the consumption of white meat, olive oil, nuts, vegetables and stir-fry, and a decrease in the consumption of processed foods. Conclusions: in diabetic patients with poor control, a nutritional educational intervention that promotes MedDM from PC improves adherence to said diet, increasing the consumption of healthy foods and decreasing harmful ones, thus optimizing metabolic control.

35406013,Non-Pharmacological Treatments for Insulin Resistance: Effective Intervention of Plant-Based Diets-A Critical Review.,"Plant-based diets are becoming increasingly popular. Vegetarian diets are better for the environment and exhibit health benefits. A correctly balanced plant-based diet is appropriate at every stage of life. Compared to omnivores, vegetarians consume more fruits and vegetables, more fibre, vitamins C and E, magnesium and less saturated fats. In general, they have better nutrition knowledge, and they are slimmer, healthier and live longer than omnivores. It also seems that following a plant-based diet prevents the onset of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity and some cancers. Food intake has a key influence on insulin resistance. Consumption of calorie-rich and highly processed foods, meats and sweetened beverages is a characteristic element of Western diets. They promote and elevate insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In contrast, intake of pulses and exclusion of meats as well as animal products bring significant benefits to vegetarian diets. According to studies, vegetarians and vegans have better blood parameters, including better glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol levels. Their homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) test results are also better. More plant-based foods and fewer animal foods in a diet result in lower insulin resistance and a lower risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of plant-based diets on insulin resistance. In this review, we focused on presenting the positive effects of vegetarian and vegan diets on insulin resistance while showing possible clinical applications of plant-based diets in the treatment and prevention of modern-age diseases. Current and reliable publications meeting the requirements of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) were taken into account in this review.",2022,diabetes

Depression and anxiety disorders are the most common mental health concerns among patients with T2D worldwide. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the impact of an online intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) on mental health outcomes (depression and anxiety) in patients with T2D in India. This retrospective pre-post analysis included adult patients (aged > 18 years) diagnosed with T2D who were enrolled in a diabetes management program in India between June 2021 and June 2023. The intervention consisted of lifestyle modifications such as a customized plant-based diet, regular physical activity, psychological support through group and individual therapy, and medical management. Data were extracted from the electronic database of the clinic, including anthropometry, medical history, biochemical parameters, symptoms of depression, and anxiety (assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorders-7 (GAD-7) scale) at the start and end of the six-month intervention period. Of the 1061 eligible patients (177 with prediabetes), 40.3% were female. The mean age, duration of diabetes, and HbA1c levels were 52 ± 10.4 years, 9.8 ± 7.8 years, and 8 ± 1.7%, respectively. The prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety (ranging from mild to severe) was 46% and 44.3%, respectively, which reduced to 28.7% and 29.2%, respectively, post-intervention. Integrated ILI successfully improved the symptoms of anxiety and depression, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach that includes diet, physical activity, psychological support, and medical management in enhancing mental health outcomes among patients with T2D. Future prospective studies are needed to explore the long-term effects of such interventions and develop effective strategies for promoting mental health in diverse populations. The study was approved by the Freedom from Diabetes Research Foundation Institutional Ethics Committee (approval number FFDRF/IEC/2024/7) and registered in the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2024/03/064596, registered on March 21, 2024).",2024,diabetes
32093385,Spanish People with Type 2 Diabetes Show an Improved Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet.,"The aim of this study was to assess the dietary pattern (i.e., Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) and healthy eating) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared with those without diabetes. In addition, we explored clinical factors associated with the dietary pattern. This cross-sectional study was performed with a sample of 476 participants (238 with T2D and 238 participants without diabetes, matched for age and sex). The alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED) score and the alternate Healthy Eating Index (aHEI) were calculated. Statistical analysis included comparison between groups and multivariable models. Participants with T2D showed higher aMED and aHEI scores (mean (SD): 4.3 (1.5) and 43.9 (6.5), respectively) in comparison with the control group (3.5 (1.8) and 39.4 (7.4), respectively; <i>p</i> < 0.001). In addition, a higher proportion of participants with T2D in higher tertiles of aMED (21.8%) and aHEI (39.9%) was observed compared with participants without diabetes (11.3% for the aMED, and 19.3% for the aHEI; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The adjusted multivariable analysis revealed that T2D (<i>p</i> <i><</i> 0.001), increasing age (<i>p</i> <i>=</i> 0.006 and <i>p</i> = 0.030, respectively), and physical activity (<i>p</i> <i>=</i> 0.009) were positively associated with higher aMED and aHEI scores. Dyslipidemia and female gender were positively associated with aMED and aHEI (<i>p</i> = 0.031 and <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively). The specific multivariable analysis for the group with T2D yielded a positive association of age (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and dyslipidemia (<i>p</i> = 0.021) with aMED. Regarding the aHEI, only female gender was positively related with this score in diabetes participants (<i>p</i> = 0.025).

40935651,Clinically Practical and Affordable Lifestyle Modification to Prevent Diabetes Mellitus in Real Practice.,"As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus continues to rise, the development of effective and sustainable prevention strategies has become a critical public health priority. Evidence from large-scale randomized controlled trials has established that lifestyle modification (LSM) programs can substantially reduce the risk of diabetes in high-risk individuals. However, routine implementation is limited by high intensity, costs, and resource requirements. We summarize major prevention trials and their effectiveness, feasibility, and limitations. Building on these insights, we introduce the Korean Diabetes Prevention Study (KDPS) as a contextually tailored model for the Korean healthcare system. The KDPS-LSM program was designed to integrate cultural and clinical relevance with practical applicability, consisting of a 6-month intensive phase of structured nutrition and lifestyle education followed by a maintenance phase to support long-term adherence. To promote sustainable change, the program incorporates the '10 habit' lifestyle messages, grounded in the transtheoretical model of behavior change, which are designed for easy implementation in daily life. This review underscores the importance of developing culturally appropriate LSM programs that balance effectiveness with feasibility, and suggests that the KDPS-LSM model could serve as a useful foundation for establishing practical diabetes prevention strategies within national healthcare systems.",2025,diabetes
40998842,CGMacros: a pilot scientific dataset for personalized nutrition and diet monitoring.,"Tracking food intake is key to using nutrition to prevent or manage common diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Several datasets are publicly available to promote research in diet monitoring, but generally contain data from a limited set of sensors (e.g., accelerometry, food images), which limits their application to specific use cases such as activity recognition or image recognition. Also lacking are publicly available datasets with food macronutrients and their associated continuous glucose measurements; datasets containing such rich information are proprietary. To address this gap, we present CGMacros, a dataset containing multimodal information from an activity tracker, two continuous glucose monitors (CGM), food macronutrients, and food photographs, as well as anonymized participant demographics, anthropometric measurements and health parameters from blood analyses and gut microbiome profiles. CGMacros contains data for 45 participants (15 healthy, 16 pre-diabetes, 14 T2D) who consumed meals with varying and known macronutrient compositions in a free-living setting for ten consecutive days. To our knowledge, this is the first database of its kind to be made publicly available. CGMacros, and larger publicly available datasets that we hope may follow, are essential to democratize academic research in personalized nutrition and algorithmic approaches to automated diet monitoring.",2025,diabetes
25220104,Lifestyle interventions to reduce risk of diabetes among women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus.,"While lifestyle interventions involving exercise and a healthy diet in high-risk adults have been found to reduce progression to type 2 diabetes by >50%, little attention has been given to the potential benefits of such strategies in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We conducted a literature search of PubMed for English language studies of randomized controlled trials of lifestyle interventions among women with a history of GDM. In total, nine studies were identified which fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The majority of randomized trials of lifestyle interventions in women with GDM have been limited to pilot or feasibility studies. However, preliminary findings suggest that such interventions can improve diabetes risk factors in women with a history of GDM. Larger, well-designed controlled randomized trials are needed to assess the effects of lifestyle interventions on preventing subsequent progression to type 2 diabetes among women with GDM.",2015,diabetes
38394635,Waking Up to the Importance of Sleep in Type 2 Diabetes Management: A Narrative Review.,"For the first time, the latest American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) consensus guidelines have incorporated a growing body of evidence linking health outcomes associated with type 2 diabetes to the movement behavior composition over the whole 24-h day. Of particular note, the importance of sleep as a key lifestyle component in the management of type 2 diabetes is promulgated and presented using three key constructs: quantity, quality, and timing (i.e., chronotype). In this narrative review we highlight some of the key evidence justifying the inclusion of sleep in the latest consensus guidelines by examining the associations of quantity, quality, and timing of sleep with measures of glycemia, cardiovascular disease risk, and mortality. We also consider potential mechanisms implicated in the association between sleep and type 2 diabetes and provide practical advice for health care professionals about initiating conversations pertaining to sleep in clinical care. In particular, we emphasize the importance of measuring sleep in a free-living environment and provide a summary of the different methodologies and targets. In summary, although the latest ADA/EASD consensus report highlights sleep as a central component in the management of type 2 diabetes, placing it, for the first time, on a level playing field with other lifestyle behaviors (e.g., physical activity and diet), the evidence base for improving sleep (beyond sleep disorders) in those living with type 2 diabetes is limited. This review should act as a timely reminder to incorporate sleep into clinical consultations, ongoing diabetes education, and future interventions.",2024,diabetes
32019083,Dietary Knowledge among Adults with Type 2 Diabetes-Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.,"Dietary management is considered as a major step in assessing a patient's knowledge related to nutritional aspects, treatment, and complications of diabetes. Diabetes patients frequently face difficulty in identifying the recommended diet, including its quality and quantity. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), sedentary lifestyle, along with food choices and portion sizes, have increased considerably and this has resulted in the soaring risk of diabetes. In addition, there is paucity of literature focusing on the Dietary Knowledge (DK) of type 2 diabetics in KSA. The study aimed to assess and evaluate the DK of type 2 diabetics. An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted among 350 type 2 diabetics using a valid and reliable self-prepared questionnaire comprising of 21 questions. Results showed that type 2 diabetics had an overall poor DK (28.57%). Sub-group analysis further revealed that diabetes patients had poor knowledge related to the consumption of carbohydrates and food choices, whereas they had good knowledge related to lipids and fats, proteins and food types. The role of diet in controlling of diabetes is considered imperative, but still, diabetes patients are unaware how they should approach this issue. The patient empowerment approach can be used to counsel patients with a poor DK. Primary care physicians and dietitians should work together and carry out individualized, tailored and patient-centered dietary education sessions.",2020,diabetes
39084054,"Lifestyle modifies the associations of early-life smoking behaviors and genetic susceptibility with type 2 diabetes: A prospective cohort study involving 433,872 individuals from UK Biobank.","To investigate whether and what lifestyle factors in later life modify the associations of early-life smoking behaviors and genetic susceptibility with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In the UK Biobank, in utero tobacco exposure (n = 354,493) and age of smoking initiation (n = 353,557) were self-reported. A composite lifestyle score was calculated based on diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep duration, and BMI. Hazard ratio (HR) and absolute risk difference (ARD) were used to estimate the associations of early-life smoking behaviors and genetic risk with incident T2D, as well as the effect modification of the lifestyle score. During a median follow-up of 14.6 years, the HRs (95 % CIs) of T2D for in utero tobacco exposure, and smoking initiation in adulthood, adolescence, and childhood, compared with no smoking behavior, were 1.19 (1.16-1.23), 1.34 (1.29-1.39), 1.58 (1.53-1.64), 2.22 (2.11-2.32), respectively (P for trend<0.001). Early-life smoking behaviors and high genetic risk (vs no smoking behavior and low genetic risk) were associated with a 302%-593 % higher T2D risk (P for additive interaction<0.05). Compared to participants with early-life smoking behaviors, high genetic risk, and an unfavorable lifestyle, those who adhered to a favorable lifestyle had a lower T2D risk in all subgroups (HRs from 0.05 to 0.36 and ARD from -14.97 % to -9.51 %), with the highest ARD attributable to lifestyle in participants with early-life smoking behaviors and high genetic risk. The T2D risk associated with early-life smoking behaviors and genetic risk was modified by a favorable lifestyle.",2024,diabetes
33634376,Personalized Nutrition for Microbiota Correction and Metabolism Restore in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients.,"Type 2 diabetes is one of the most common noncommunicable diseases in the world. Recent studies suggest a link between type 2 diabetes and microbiota, as well as the ability to treat and prevent it using personalized approaches to nutrition. In this work, we conducted clinical studies on the effects of a personalized diet on 56 female patients. Biochemical, physical, and immunological parameters were measured by standard methods on days 1 and 18 of the experiment. Gut and oral microbiota studies were performed in dynamics on days 1, 7, 11, and 18 using real-time polymerase chain reaction. With the help of the developed information system, a personalized diet was developed for each participant of the experiment. In the group of patients following personalized diets a statistically significant decreasing levels of glucose, thymol test, creatinine, very low-density lipoprotein, urea, secretory IgA, and tumour necrosis factor-α, and improvement in all physical parameters were observed. There was a statistically significant increase in uric acid, sodium, and magnesium. Statistically significant changes in gut microbiota were observed in Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli (lac+, lac-), Lactobacillus spp., and Candida spp. Such microorganisms of oral microbiota as E. faecalis, Lactobacillus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida spp. demonstrated statistically significant changes. All these changes indicate an improvement in the patients' condition in the experimental group compared to the control group. Our algorithm used for the development of personalized diets for patients with diabetes type 2 demonstrated clinical efficacy of its implementation.",2022,diabetes
40106009,Nutritional Approach to Diabetic Sarcopenia: A Comprehensive Review.,"The aim of this review is to discuss and evaluate diabetic sarcopenia (DS) and its relationship with nutrition by discussing the mechanisms of diabetic sarcopenia in detail and comprehensively reviewing the literature. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) affects approximately 25% of people aged 50 years and over and indicates a significant the cost of health for the elderly. Nutrition is an important part of these treatment approaches, and in this review, the literature was comprehensively reviewed, focusing on understanding the mechanisms of DS and discussing its relationship with nutrition. A comprehensive search was conducted on Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed from inception up to July 2024. The aim of nutritional treatment for DS is to improve muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance while improving diabetes-related metabolic risk and glucose levels. In this context, it is important to determine energy intake in individuals with DS according to calorie intake exceeding 30 kcal/kg. For these individuals, a protein intake of at least 1-1.2 g/kg/day is recommended, with an emphasis on the number and timing of meals and a nutritional pattern rich in branched chain amino acids (BCAA). In addition, it is important to adopt a diet rich in antioxidants and to choose diet patterns that contain sufficient levels of macro and micronutrients. The Mediterranean diet model can be a good diet option for individuals with DS. Comprehensive studies in this field are needed so that clinicians can make specific dietary recommendations for DS.",2025,diabetes
27374251,Dietary Patterns and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in a First Nations Community.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a growing concern worldwide, particularly in Indigenous communities, which have undergone a marked nutrition transition characterized by reduced intakes of traditional foods and increased intakes of market foods. Few studies have assessed the relationships between differing dietary patterns and risk for type 2 diabetes in Indigenous communities in Canada. The objective of the study was to characterize dietary patterns using factor analysis (FA) and to relate these patterns to the incidence of type 2 diabetes after 10 years of follow up in a First Nations community in Ontario, Canada. We conducted a prospective analysis of 492 participants in the SLHDP who did not have diabetes at baseline (1993 to 1995) and were followed for 10 years. A food-frequency questionnaire was administered, and FA was used to identify patterns of food consumption. Multivariate logistic regression analyses determined associations of food patterns with incident type 2 diabetes, adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle confounders. At follow up, 86 participants had developed incident type 2 diabetes. FA revealed 3 prominent dietary patterns: Balanced Market Foods, Beef and Processed Foods and Traditional Foods. After adjustment for age, sex, waist circumference, interleukin-6 and adiponectin, the Beef and Processed Foods pattern was associated with increased risk for incident type 2 diabetes (OR=1.38; 95% CI 1.02, 1.86). In contrast, the Balanced Market Foods and Traditional Foods Patterns were not significantly associated with type 2 diabetes. Dietary interventions should encourage reduced consumption of unhealthful market foods, in combination with improvements in local food environments so as to increase access to healthful foods and reduce food insecurity in Indigenous communities.",2016,diabetes
40906542,Heterogeneity in Phenotype and Early Metabolic Response to Lifestyle Interventions in Type 2 Diabetes in China Using a Tree-Like Representation.,"Deciphering the heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes in prognosis and treatment effect is essential. We used a novel dimensionality reduction approach to describe the type 2 diabetes phenotype continuum and visualize the difference in lifestyle intervention efficacy in Chinese patients. Based on 17,816 participants with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (aged ≥40 years) from a nationwide cohort, 12 key phenotypes were residualized for age and sex to construct a two-dimensional tree structure. The tree demonstrated the continuous type 2 diabetes spectrum and region-specific characteristics, with a mixed phenotypic trunk and three extreme phenotypic branches. When mapping data from 325 participants with type 2 diabetes from a randomized controlled trial onto the original tree, lifestyle intervention induced a migration toward the left part of tree, indicating an overall metabolic improvement. Specifically, diet intervention was more effective for glycemic control in the upper part of the tree and featured moderate diabesity and elevated insulin, whereas exercise intervention was more effective for glycemic control in the left side of the tree and featured less adiposity and better overall metabolic status. In summary, this analysis depicted the tree structure representing the underlying pathophysiological features of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and identified tree regions with different sensitivity to diet or exercise intervention. The results have the potential to aid lifestyle intervention selection. Deciphering the heterogeneity of diabetes is essential for prognosis prediction and treatment guidance, but current classifications are flawed because they lose continuous phenotypic information. We wanted to determine if the novel data reduction method, the data dimensionality reduction tree (DDRTree), is applicable to visualizing the phenotypic continuum, comorbid conditions, and lifestyle intervention effects in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. The DDRTree structure demonstrated the region-specific characteristics of type 2 diabetes. Diet intervention was more effective for glycemic control in the upper part of the tree, featuring moderate diabesity, whereas exercise intervention was more effective in the left side of the tree, featuring less adiposity and better overall metabolic status. The Chinese type 2 diabetes tree structure indicates individualized pathophysiology and guides the selection of lifestyle intervention.",2025,diabetes
32172486,The genetic basis of high-carbohydrate and high-monosodium glutamate diet related to the increase of likelihood of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a review.,"Diabetes is one of the most common metabolic diseases. Aside from the genetic factor, previous studies stated that other factors such as environment, lifestyle, and paternal-maternal condition play critical roles in diabetes through DNA methylation in specific areas of the genome. One of diabetic cases is caused by insulin resistance and changing the homeostasis of blood glucose control so glucose concentration stood beyond normal rate (hyperglycemia). High fat diet has been frequently studied and linked to triggering diabetes. However, most Asians consume rice (or food with high carbohydrate) and food with monosodium glutamate (MSG). This habit could lead to pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Previous studies showed that high-carbohydrate or high-MSG diet could change gene expression or modify protein activity in body metabolism. This imbalanced metabolism can lead to pleiotropic effects of diabetes mellitus. In this study, the authors have attempted to relate various changes in genes expression or protein activity to the high-carbohydrate and high-MSG-induced diabetes. The authors have also tried to relate several genes that contribute to pathophysiology of T2D and proposed several ideas of genes as markers and target for curing people with T2D. These are done by investigating altered activities of various genes that cause or are caused by diabetes. These genes are selected based on their roles in pathophysiology of T2D.",2020,diabetes
38518862,Modelling remission from overweight type 2 diabetes reveals how altering advice may counter relapse.,"The development or remission of diet-induced overweight type 2 diabetes involves many biological changes which occur over very different timescales. Remission, defined by HbA<sub>1c</sub><6.5%, or fasting plasma glucose concentration G<126 mg/dl, may be achieved rapidly by following weight loss guidelines. However, remission is often short-term, followed by relapse. Mathematical modelling provides a way of investigating a typical situation, in which patients are advised to lose weight and then maintain fat mass, a slow variable. Remission followed by relapse, in a modelling sense, is equivalent to changing from a remission trajectory with steady state G<126 mg/dl, to a relapse trajectory with steady state G≥126 mg/dl. Modelling predicts that a trajectory which maintains weight will be a relapse trajectory, if the fat mass chosen is too high, the threshold being dependent on the lipid to carbohydrate ratio of the diet. Modelling takes into account the effects of hepatic and pancreatic lipid on hepatic insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, respectively. This study leads to the suggestion that type 2 diabetes remission guidelines be given in terms of model parameters, not variables; that is, the patient should adhere to a given nutrition and exercise plan, rather than achieve a certain subset of variable values. The model predicts that calorie restriction, not weight loss, initiates remission from type 2 diabetes; and that advice of the form 'adhere to the diet and exercise plan' rather than 'achieve a certain weight loss' may help counter relapse.",2024,diabetes
39049121,Diabetes Telemedicine Mediterranean Diet (DiaTeleMed) Study: study protocol for a fully remote randomized clinical trial evaluating personalized dietary management in individuals with type 2 diabetes.,"The Diabetes Telemedicine Mediterranean Diet (DiaTeleMed) Study is a fully remote randomized clinical trial evaluating personalized dietary management in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The study aims to test the efficacy of a personalized behavioral approach for dietary management of moderately controlled T2D, versus a standardized behavioral intervention that uses one-size-fits-all dietary recommendations, versus a usual care control (UCC). The primary outcome will compare the impact of each intervention on the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE). Eligible participants are between 21 and 80 years of age diagnosed with moderately controlled T2D (HbA1c: 6.0 to 8.0%) and managed on lifestyle alone or lifestyle plus metformin. Participants must be willing and able to attend virtual counseling sessions and log meals into a dietary tracking smartphone application (DayTwo), and wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for up to 12 days. Participants are randomized with equal allocation (n = 255, n = 85 per arm) to one of three arms: (1) Personalized, (2) Standardized, or (3) UCC. Measurements occur at 0 (baseline), 3, and 6 months. All participants receive isocaloric energy and macronutrient targets to meet Mediterranean diet guidelines, in addition to 14 intervention contacts over 6 months (4 weekly then 10 biweekly) to cover diabetes self-management education. The first 4 UCC intervention contacts are delivered via synchronous videoconferences followed by educational video links. Participants in Standardized receive the same educational content as those in the UCC arm, following the same schedule. However, all intervention contacts are conducted via synchronous videoconferences, paired with Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)-based behavioral counseling, plus dietary self-monitoring of planned meals using a mobile app that provides real-time feedback on calories and macronutrients. Participants in the Personalized arm receive all elements of the Standardized intervention, in addition to real-time feedback on predicted post-prandial glycemic response (PPGR) to meals and snacks logged into the mobile app. The DiaTeleMed Study aims to address an important gap in the current landscape of precision nutrition by determining the contributions of behavioral counseling and personalized nutrition recommendations on glycemic control in individuals with T2D. The fully remote methodology of the study allows for scalability and innovative delivery of personalized dietary recommendations at a population level. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05046886.

38961430,A holistic lifestyle mobile health intervention for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and common mental disorders in Asian women with a history of gestational diabetes: a randomised control trial with 3-year follow-up protocol.,"Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are 12-fold more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) 4-6 years after delivery than women without GDM. Similarly, GDM is associated with the development of common mental disorders (CMDs) (e.g. anxiety and depression). Evidence shows that holistic lifestyle interventions focusing on physical activity (PA), dietary intake, sleep, and mental well-being strategies can prevent T2D and CMDs. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a holistic lifestyle mobile health intervention (mHealth) with post-GDM women in preventing T2D and CMDs in a community setting in Singapore. The study consists of a 1-year randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a 3-year follow-up period. Post-GDM women with no current diabetes diagnosis and not planning to become pregnant will be eligible for the study. In addition, participants will complete mental well-being questionnaires (e.g. depression, anxiety, sleep) and their child's socio-emotional and cognitive development. The participants will be randomised to either Group 1 (Intervention) or Group 2 (comparison). The intervention group will receive the ""LVL UP App"", a smartphone-based, conversational agent-delivered holistic lifestyle intervention focused on three pillars: Move More (PA), Eat Well (Diet), and Stress Less (mental wellbeing). The intervention consists of health literacy and psychoeducational coaching sessions, daily ""Life Hacks"" (healthy activity suggestions), slow-paced breathing exercises, a step tracker (including brisk steps), a low-burden food diary, and a journaling tool. Women from both groups will be provided with an Oura ring for tracking physical activity, sleep, and heart rate variability (a proxy for stress), and the ""HAPPY App"", a mHealth app which provides health promotion information about PA, diet, sleep, and mental wellbeing, as well as display body mass index, blood pressure, and results from the oral glucose tolerance tests. Short-term aggregate effects will be assessed at 26/27 weeks (midpoint) and a 1-year visit, followed by a 2, 3, and 4-year follow-up period. High rates of progression of T2D and CMDs in women with post-GDM suggest an urgent need to promote a healthy lifestyle, including diet, PA, sleep, and mental well-being. Preventive interventions through a holistic, healthy lifestyle may be the solution, considering the inextricable relationship between physical and psychological health. We expect that holistic lifestyle mHealth may effectively support behavioural changes among women with a history of GDM to prevent T2D and CMDs.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of primary prevention interventions in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D in the 28 EU member states (EU-28). The present systematic review is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020219994), and it followed the PRISMA guidelines. Eligibility criteria comprised original interventional studies reporting incidence of T2D in member states of the EU-28. A total of 23,437 records were initially retrieved, of which 16 met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. These interventional studies, published between 2003 and 2021, provided data from Spain, the UK, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Thirteen studies were of low quality, two were moderate, and one was high-quality. Three studies focused solely on dietary interventions, twelve studies combined diet, physical activity, and lifestyle counseling, and one study applied repeated health checks with personalized feedback and lifestyle advice. Overall, 10 studies reported a significant reduction in T2D incidence exclusively among high-risk individuals following the interventions with HR: 0.4 (95% CI: 0.3-0.7) to 0.75 (95% CI: 0.58-0.96). Only a few studies reported that primary lifestyle interventions decreased T2D risk, thus limiting generalizability. While lifestyle improvements were noted on high-risk groups, significant risk reduction among healthy individuals was not observed. Multicomponent interventions combining dietary modifications, physical activity, and personalized lifestyle counseling were the most effective in reducing the incidence of T2D among high-risk populations in the EU-28.",2025,diabetes
37960319,Lifestyle Interventions to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes in Women with a History of Gestational Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis through the Lens of Health Equity.,"Type 2 diabetes mellites is one of the health problems disproportionally affecting people with low socioeconomic statuses. Gestational diabetes mellites increases the risk of type 2 diabetes by up to ten-fold for women. Lifestyle interventions prevent type 2 diabetes in women with prior gestational diabetes. However, it is unknown if similar effectiveness can be expected for all population subgroups. This study aims to assess the prevention of type 2 diabetes in women with prior gestational diabetes using population characteristics according to the PROGRESS (place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture/language, occupation, gender/sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status, and social capital) criteria. MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and EBM Reviews databases were searched for interventional studies of diet, physical activity, or behavioural interventions published up to 21 February 2023. Random effects subgroup meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of population characteristics and intervention effects. All studies were conducted in high-income countries or middle-income countries. Two-thirds of the studies reported on race/ethnicity and education level. Less than one-third reported on place (urban/rural), occupation, and socioeconomic status. None reported on religion or social capital. Studies from high-income countries (MD = -1.46; 95% CI: -2.27, -0.66, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 70.46, <i>p</i> < 0.001) showed a greater reduction in bodyweight compared with the studies conducted in middle-income countries (MD = -0.11; 95% CI: -1.12, 0.89, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 69.31, <i>p</i> < 0.001) (<i>p</i> for subgroup difference = 0.04). There are significant equity gaps in the evidence for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in women with prior gestational diabetes due to reports on population characteristics being poor. Interventions may be less effective in reducing bodyweight in women from middle-income countries compared to high-income countries. Collecting and analysing data related to equity is needed to understand the effect of lifestyle interventions on type 2 diabetes for different population subgroups.",2023,diabetes
37968391,Quasi-experimental evaluation of a nationwide diabetes prevention programme.,"Diabetes is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality and cost of illness<sup>1,2</sup>. Health behaviours, particularly those related to nutrition and physical activity, play a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus<sup>3</sup>. Whereas behaviour change programmes (also known as lifestyle interventions or similar) have been found efficacious in controlled clinical trials<sup>4,5</sup>, there remains controversy about whether targeting health behaviours at the individual level is an effective preventive strategy for type 2 diabetes mellitus<sup>6</sup> and doubt among clinicians that lifestyle advice and counselling provided in the routine health system can achieve improvements in health<sup>7-9</sup>. Here we show that being referred to the largest behaviour change programme for prediabetes globally (the English Diabetes Prevention Programme) is effective in improving key cardiovascular risk factors, including glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), excess body weight and serum lipid levels. We do so by using a regression discontinuity design<sup>10</sup>, which uses the eligibility threshold in HbA1c for referral to the behaviour change programme, in electronic health data from about one-fifth of all primary care practices in England. We confirm our main finding, the improvement of HbA1c, using two other quasi-experimental approaches: difference-in-differences analysis exploiting the phased roll-out of the programme and instrumental variable estimation exploiting regional variation in programme coverage. This analysis provides causal, rather than associational, evidence that lifestyle advice and counselling implemented at scale in a national health system can achieve important health improvements.",2023,diabetes

Type 2 diabetes patients' adherence to recommended diet is shown to improve their health outcomes. This study investigated dietary compliance and its determinants among type 2 diabetes patients in Tamale Metropolis, Ghana. This study employed analytical cross-sectional study design and involved 343 participants selected through systematic random sampling from the outpatient diabetes clinics of Tamale Teaching Hospital, Tamale West Hospital and Tamale Central Hospital. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to document participants' socio-demographic, lifestyle and clinical characteristics. The modified Morisky dietary adherence scale was used to assess dietary compliance. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the predictors of dietary compliance. The mean age of participants was 56.4 ± 15.7 years. More than half of the participants (62.4%) were females. The participants had a higher compliance status (70.6%). The study also revealed that, as a patient's age increases, compliance decreases [Adjusted odd ratio (AOR): 0.96, 95%, Confidence interval (CI) 0.94-0.99, P = 0.002]. Regarding educational status, patients who completed JHS/Middle School [AOR: 2.458, 95% CI 1.019-5.928, P = 0.045] and SHS/Vocational School [AOR: 2.73, 95% CI 1.08-6.91, P = 0.035] were more likely to comply with dietary recommendations compared to those with no formal education.

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed ethnic differences in the effects of lifestyle interventions on T2DM incidence, glycemic outcomes (fasting glucose, 2-h glucose, HbA<sub>1c</sub> ), anthropometric measures (weight, BMI, waist circumference), and lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, energy intake, energy from fat, fiber intake). MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other databases were searched (to June 15, 2020) for randomized and non-randomized controlled trials on lifestyle interventions (diet and/or physical activity) in adults at risk of T2DM. Ethnicity was categorized into European, South Asian, East and Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin American, and African groups. Forty-four studies were included in meta-analyses. Overall, lifestyle interventions resulted in significant improvement in T2DM incidence, glycemic outcomes, anthropometric measures, physical activity, and energy intake (all P < 0.01). Significant subgroup differences by ethnicity were found for 2-h glucose, weight, BMI, and waist circumference (all P < 0.05) but not for T2DM incidence, fasting glucose, HbA<sub>1c</sub> , and physical activity (all P > 0.05). Few studies in non-European groups reported dietary intake.

The study population included 165,383 European American (EA), African American (AA), Native Hawaiian (NH), Japanese American (JA), and Latino (L) participants. The LSRI score, assessed by baseline questionnaire, assigns 1 point each for no current smoking, physical activity (≥ 150 min/week), consuming < 1 (women) or < 2 (men) alcoholic drinks/day and adhering to ≥ 3 of 7 dietary recommendations. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated by Cox regression. During a mean follow-up of 17 years, 44,518 (27%) incident T2D cases were identified. Adherence was highest for moderate alcohol (86%) and no current smoking (84%), followed by physical activity (81%) and diet (22%). A 1-point increase in LSRI was associated with a 6% lower incidence of T2D (HR = 0.94; 95%CI 0.93-0.95) in the BMI-adjusted model. No current smoking, physical activity, and healthy diet (without BMI adjustment only) were inversely and moderate alcohol consumption positively associated with T2D incidence. The LSRI was associated with lower T2D risk in BMI-adjusted models for participants with AA, L, and EA ancestry and among JA before BMI adjustment. These results confirm that a combination of lifestyle behaviors is critical in T2D prevention. However, not all LSRI components impact T2D risk equally, and both, associations and the impact of BMI adjustment, vary by ethnic group.",2025,diabetes

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the lifestyle and self-monitoring of type 2 diabetes patients using the Healthy Lifestyle and Self-Monitoring Questionnaire. <i>Material and Methods</i>: The analyses conducted were based on data collected using the Polish version of the Healthy Lifestyle and Self-Control Questionnaire among 104 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes who were treated at the Diabetes Outpatient Clinic. The in-house study also included an analysis of the relationship between lifestyle habits and disease acceptance and chronic disease functioning. <i>Results</i>: Respondents scored statistically significantly higher for the Healthy Lifestyle and Self-Monitoring Questionnaire than the norms assume, and the largest differences were observed in terms of the healthy dietary choices subscale (t = 8.07; <i>p</i> < 0.05). Only for the subscale of organized exercise were no statistically significant differences found (t = 0.50; <i>p</i> = 0.620). <i>Conclusions</i>: Type 2 diabetes is one of the diseases in which lifestyle not only contributes to its development but is also associated with its course and treatment outcomes. Reinforcing a health-promoting lifestyle is one of the cornerstones of treating patients with type 2 diabetes.",2024,diabetes
36771207,Effect of the Ketogenic Diet on the Prophylaxis and Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus: A Review of the Meta-Analyses and Clinical Trials.,"The exponentially growing frequency of diagnosing diabetes mellitus means that a verification of the previous dietetic approach to treating the disease seems justified. The simultaneous growth of interest in the ketogenic diet and the development of knowledge in this field have contributed to the increasingly frequent application of the ketogenic diet in diabetes treatment. This paper also deals with that issue; its aim includes an extensive analysis of the influence of the ketogenic diet on the prophylaxis and treatment of diabetes. The paper has been prepared based on a wide, meticulous analysis of the available literature on the subject. Among other findings, a favorable effect of that nutrition model has been demonstrated on the values of glycated hemoglobin, glucose, insulin, or other metabolic parameters in diabetes patients. The effect of the ketogenic diet on the pharmacotherapy of type 1 and type 2 diabetes has been presented and compared with the standard nutritional management plan recommended for that disease. Further research is needed in this field, especially studies with a long follow-up period. The discussed articles report interesting therapeutic advantages to the ketogenic diet in comparison with standard diets.",2023,diabetes
34713743,Barriers to Healthy Eating and Diabetes Diet Education: Divergent Perspectives of Patients and Their Providers.,"Patients report that adhering to diet is the most challenging aspect of diabetes management. Provision of diet education is often delegated to health care providers, despite a lack of nutrition education and training and limited awareness of environmental and cultural challenges faced by patients. <i>Aim</i>. We examined perceived barriers to diet self-management among low-income minority patients with type 2 diabetes and their health care providers within a single ecosystem, to test whether providers understood patient barriers. <i>Method.</i> We surveyed 149 members of a safety-net clinic (99 patients, 50 providers), using barriers derived from the literature. Binomial logistic regression was applied to investigate relationships between barriers and patients' sociodemographic variables and Pearson's χ<sup>2</sup> was used to compare differences in perceived barriers between patients and providers. <i>Results.</i> Providers expressed divergent perceptions of patients' barriers to healthy eating, including more total barriers and little agreement with patients on their relative importance. Largest differences in providers' perceptions of patient barriers included poor motivation, high use of fast food, inadequate family support, and lack of cooking skills-all suggesting patient inadequacy. In contrast, patients showed evidence of high motivation-in rate of blood glucose measurement and desire for diet education. Patients identified primary care providers as a main source of nutrition education, yet providers indicated lack of time for diet discussion and preferred other staff do the teaching. <i>Conclusion.</i> The findings from this study strongly suggest that health systems need to consider patient, provider, and system barriers when implementing nutrition education and management programs.",2022,diabetes
26494579,The role of patient education in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes: an overview.,"The management of type 2 diabetes mellitus includes ability and empowerment of the patient to change lifestyle, maintain an adequate diet and physical activity, manage the disease, and follow a specific program of periodic medical checks and education sessions. In addition, the patient should be able to correctly identify and adequately solve problems related to the disease and actively collaborate with the healthcare system. To obtain these goals, therapeutic patient education (TPE) is now considered a crucial element not only in the treatment but also in the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Several trials showed that TPE is able to improve clinical, lifestyle, and psycho-social outcomes. Nevertheless, studies have not clarified the ideal characteristics of a comprehensive patient education program in clinical practice. Other work is needed to answer open questions regarding the type of PTE (individual or group education), themes, frequency and number of education sessions, contact time between educator and patient, background of educators, use of new technologies, and barriers to self-management. The present review discusses these points on the basis of the most recent data of the literature.",2016,diabetes
35434784,Selecting a target population for type 2 diabetes lifestyle prevention programs: A cost-effectiveness perspective.,"Cost-effectiveness (CE) of lifestyle change programs (LCP) for type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention is influenced by a participant's risk. We identified the risk threshold of developing T2D in the intervention population that was cost-effective for three formats of the LCP: delivered in-person individually or in groups, or delivered virtually. We compared the cost-effectiveness across program formats when there were more than one cost-effective formats. Using the CDC-RTI T2D CE Simulation model, we estimated CEs associated with 3 program formats in 8 population groups with an annual T2D incidence of 1% to 8%. We generated a nationally representative simulation population for each risk level using the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. We used an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in 25-years, to measure the CEs of the programs. We took a health care system perspective. To achieve an ICER of $50,000/QALY or lower, the annual T2D incidence of the program participant needed to be ≥5% for the in-person individual program, ≥4% for the digital individual program, and ≥3% for the in-person group program. For those with T2D risk of ≥4%, the in-person group program always dominated the digital individual program. The in-person individual program was cost-effective compared with the in-person group program only among persons with T2D risk of ≥8%. Our findings could assist decision-makers in selecting the most appropriate target population for different formats of lifestyle intervention programs to prevent T2D.",2022,diabetes
26246592,Socioeconomic Status and the Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Among Adults in Northwest China.,"The purpose of the study was to investigate (1) the associations of socioeconomic status, lifestyle risk factors, and the prevalence of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and (2) the mediating effects of lifestyle risk factors on the association of socioeconomic status and the prevalence of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes among Chinese adults in northwest China. Based on a correlational design and random multistage sampling in communities (N = 3243), data were collected through face-to-face interviews and anthropometric measurements. Education, occupation, and income were considered indicators of socioeconomic status. Approximately 7.5% persons interviewed had newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Chi-square analyses showed that higher socioeconomic indicators (higher income, nonmanual occupation) were associated with increased risk. Lifestyle risk factors, including alcohol use, unhealthy diet, and higher body mass index, were significantly positively associated with type 2 diabetes. Adjusting for demographic characteristics, hierarchical logistic regression analyses showed that unhealthy diet and high body mass index were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes. Higher incomes and nonmanual occupations were related to a greater prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and high body mass index mediated these associations. These findings suggest that interventions for type 2 diabetes in China should be targeted at populations with high socioeconomic status and nonmanual occupations to reduce lifestyle risk factors and prevent diabetes.",2015,diabetes
36402187,Long-term exposure to transportation noise and risk of type 2 diabetes: A cohort study.,"Some studies have found transportation noise to be associated with higher diabetes risk. This includes studies based on millions of participants, relying entirely on register-based confounder adjustment, which raises concern about residual lifestyle confounding. We aimed to investigate associations between noise and type 2 diabetes (T2D), including investigation of effects of increasing confounder adjustment for register-data and lifestyle. In a cohort of 286,151 participants randomly selected across Denmark in 2010-2013 and followed up until 2017, we identified 7574 incident T2D cases. Based on residential address-history for all participants linked with exposure assessment of high spatial resolution, we calculated 10-year time-weighted mean road and railway noise at the most (LdenMax) and least (LdenMin) exposed façades and air pollution (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). We used Cox models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with increasing adjustment for individual- and area-level register-based sociodemographic covariates, self-reported lifestyle and air pollution. We found that a 10 dB increase in 10-year mean road LdenMin was associated with HRs (95% CI) of 1.06 (1.02-1.10) after adjustment for age, sex and year, 1.08 (1.04-1.13) after further adjustment for register-based sociodemographic covariates, 1.07 (1.03-1.12) after further lifestyle adjustment (e.g. smoking, diet and alcohol) and 1.06 (1.02-1.11) after further PM<sub>2.5</sub> adjustment. For road LdenMax, the corresponding HRs were 1.07 (1.04-1.10), 1.05 (1.02-1.08), 1.04 (1.01-1.07) and 1.03 (1.00-1.06). Railway noise was associated with HRs of 1.04 (0.98-1.11) for LdenMax and 1.02 (0.92-1.12) for LdenMin after adjustment for sociodemographic and lifestyle covariates and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Long-term exposure to road traffic noise was associated with T2D, which together with previous literature indicates that T2D should be considered when calculating health impacts of noise. After sociodemographic adjustment, further lifestyle adjustment only changed HRs slightly, suggesting that large register-based studies with adjustment for key sociodemographic covariates can produce reliable results.",2023,diabetes
29375034,Diet/lifestyle and risk of diabetes and glycemic traits: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies have demonstrated diet/lifestyle play roles in development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM); however, it remains unclear whether these relationships are causal. A two-sample MR approach was used to examine the causal effect of diet/lifestyle upon risk of T2DM and glycemic traits. The protein intake-increasing allele C of FTO was significant associated with higher risk of T2DM (Beta ± SE = 0.104 ± 0.014, P = 4.40 × 10<sup>- 11</sup>), higher level of HOMA-IR (Beta ± SE = 0.016 ± 0.004, P = 9.55 × 10<sup>- 5</sup>), HOMA-B (Beta ± SE = 0.008 ± 0.003, P = 0.020). Using MR analyses, increased protein intake was causally associated with an increased risk of T2DM (Beta ± SE = 0.806 ± 0.260, P = 0.002). In addition, smoking cessation was causally associated with increased levels of glycemic traits such as HOMA-IR (Beta ± SE = 0.165 ± 0.072, P = 0.021), fasting insulin (Beta ± SE = 0.132 ± 0.066, P = 0.047) and fasting glucose (Beta ± SE = 0.132 ± 0.064, P = 0.039). These results provide evidence supporting a causal role for higher protein intake and smoking cession in T2DM. Our study provides further rationale for individuals at risk for diabetes to keep healthy lifestyle.",2018,diabetes
31386561,Type 2 diabetes prevalence among Canadian adults - dietary habits and sociodemographic risk factors.,"Patients with diagnosed diabetes receive recommendations by their healthcare providers about lifestyle modification, particularly on diet. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of type 2 diagnosed diabetes, undetected (undiagnosed) type 2 diabetes, and prediabetes of Canadian adults, and to evaluate whether individuals with diagnosed diabetes have different dietary intakes compared with the other groups. We used nationally representative data from Canadian Health Measures Survey Cycles 1 and 2 (<i>n</i> = 6807, representing estimated population of 23 022 890). We evaluated prevalence of diagnosed diabetes, undetected diabetes, and prediabetes and their distribution across sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. The intake from different food/food groups was compared between those with diagnosed diabetes and the rest of the population. Among Canadians 20-79 years of age, 12.4% had prediabetes, and 7.5% had diabetes. Among all diabetes cases, 37.3% were undiagnosed. All 3 diabetic categories were more prevalent among older age groups (60-79 years) compared with younger age (20-39 years) groups. Diagnosed diabetes and prediabetes were more prevalent among less educated individuals compared with the higher educated ones. Diagnosed diabetes was more common among individuals with lower-middle income level compared with the highest income level. Diagnosed diabetes individuals had lower intake from juice and ice cream and higher intake from potatoes and diet soft drinks compared with other groups. More than 600 000 adults were unaware of their diabetes status; the aware ones had lower intakes of sugar-containing foods. In evaluating the association between dietary intake and risk of chronic diseases in populations, diagnosed diabetes cases should be evaluated separately.",2019,diabetes
38336461,Very low calorie diets and total diet replacement in type 2 diabetes: where are we now?,"Management of type 2 diabetes has now been simplified by the understanding that the condition is caused by excess fat in the liver together with suppression of beta cell function by the associated excess liver export of fat. These factors can be reversed by substantial weight loss leading to remission in the early years after diagnosis, or at least major decrease in cardiovascular risks and improvement in glucose control for all. Weight loss by any means is successful, but it is most easily achieved by rapid action using a low or very low calorie diet of around 800 kcal/day followed by sustained modest restraint of dietary habits. Oral hypoglycaemic agents and one antihypertensive drug can be withdrawn on day 1 of the weight loss diet, raising the importance of appropriate deprescribing.",2024,diabetes

35956399,Association of Polygenic Variants with Type 2 Diabetes Risk and Their Interaction with Lifestyles in Asians.,"Over the last several decades, there has been a considerable growth in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in Asians. A pathophysiological mechanism in Asian T2DM is closely linked to low insulin secretion, β-cell mass, and inability to compensate for insulin resistance. We hypothesized that genetic variants associated with lower β-cell mass and function and their combination with unhealthy lifestyle factors significantly raise T2DM risk among Asians. This hypothesis was explored with participants aged over 40. Participants were categorized into T2DM (case; n = 5383) and control (n = 53,318) groups. The genetic variants associated with a higher risk of T2DM were selected from a genome-wide association study in a city hospital-based cohort, and they were confirmed with a replicate study in Ansan/Ansung plus rural cohorts. The interacted genetic variants were identified with generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis, and the polygenic risk score (PRS)-nutrient interactions were examined. The 8-SNP model was positively associated with T2DM risk by about 10 times, exhibiting a higher association than the 20-SNP model, including all T2DM-linked SNPs with p < 5 × 10−6. The SNPs in the models were primarily involved in pancreatic β-cell growth and survival. The PRS of the 8-SNP model interacted with three lifestyle factors: energy intake based on the estimated energy requirement (EER), Western-style diet (WSD), and smoking status. Fasting serum glucose concentrations were much higher in the participants with High-PRS in rather low EER intake and high-WSD compared to the High-EER and Low-WSD, respectively. They were shown to be higher in the participants with High-PRS in smokers than in non-smokers. In conclusion, the genetic impact of T2DM risk was mainly involved with regulating pancreatic β-cell mass and function, and the PRS interacted with lifestyles. These results highlight the interaction between genetic impacts and lifestyles in precision nutrition.",2022,diabetes
38646983,Glycaemic control among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries: an updated review.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become a major public health concern, causing significant disability and death worldwide. Fuelled by a modern sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary practices, T2DM affects at least 10.5% of the world's population. This paper seeks to review the progress made by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) in addressing T2DM, focusing on glycaemic control proportions and comparing it with the 2015 review. The results indicate no significant improvement in glycaemic control proportions since the last review, with only 9.2% to 56.9% of patients having good control (glycosylated haemoglobin < 7%). However, there are no significant differences in glycaemic control between the GCC countries and other places worldwide despite being considered hotbeds of T2DM. Many factors contribute to poor glycaemic control. Specifically, evidence shows that being overweight or obese is the most common modifiable risk factor for T2DM incidence and poor glycaemic control. The GCC countries have higher rates of obesity. Additionally, poor glycaemic control is mainly related to a lack of adherence to insulin and medication use. Poor diet, rich in calories and low in fruits and vegetables, and a sedentary lifestyle also significantly contribute to poor glycaemic control and obesity. Therefore, to reduce the incidence of disease and improve glycaemic control in diabetic patients, educational programs promoting lifestyle changes should be implemented. Ongoing research is also necessary to assess the trend of glycaemic control and its risk factors in our region.",2024,diabetes

Preliminary results showed that patients in the lifestyle group were interested in preventive strategies, reporting better learning experience and higher motivation than those in the medication group. Future research is needed to design approaches tailored to patients in the medication group.",2022,diabetes
29269510,Long-term Diet Quality and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Among Urban Chinese Adults.,"Little evidence exists regarding long-term diet quality and the risk of type 2 diabetes among Asian populations, who have undergone a nutrition transition and a diabetes epidemic. A total of 117,919 Chinese men and women, 40-74 years old, free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer at baseline, were followed from 1996 to 2015. Diet quality was assessed by a healthy diet score (HDS) based on eight commonly consumed food groups previously suggested to be related to diabetes. Long-term diet quality and its changes were assessed by repeated surveys using food-frequency questionnaires. We identified 6,111 incident diabetes cases during a mean follow-up of 11.5 years. Higher HDS was associated with lower diabetes risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.85 [95% CI 0.78-0.92] in the highest vs. lowest quintile, <i>P</i><sub>continuous</sub> <0.0001) after adjustment for potential confounders including BMI. Maintaining a high HDS during follow-up was associated with 26% lower risk compared with a consistently low HDS (HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.63-0.85]). The inverse association between HDS and diabetes was observed regardless of participants' age, sex, smoking and exercise habits, obesity status, and metabolic disease status but was more prominent among those who participated in leisure-time exercise (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub> = 0.004). When considered jointly, a sustained high HDS plus exercise was associated with a 45% reduced risk of diabetes (HR 0.55 [95% CI 0.45-0.67]). A high-quality diet, especially maintained over the long term and in conjunction with leisure-time exercise, is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes among urban Chinese adults.",2018,diabetes

35373896,"Types of diet, obesity, and incident type 2 diabetes: Findings from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study.","To investigate the associations between types of diet and incident type 2 diabetes and whether adiposity mediated these associations. In total, 203 790 participants from UK Biobank (mean age 55.2 years; 55.8% women) without diabetes at baseline were included in this prospective study. Using the dietary intake data self-reported at baseline, participants were categorized as vegetarians (n = 3237), fish eaters (n = 4405), fish and poultry eaters (n = 2217), meat eaters (n = 178 004) and varied diet (n = 15 927). The association between type of diet and incident type 2 diabetes was investigated using Cox-proportional hazards models with a 2-year landmark analysis. The mediation role of adiposity was tested under a counterfactual framework. After excluding the first 2 years of follow-up, the median follow-up was 5.4 (IQR: 4.8-6.3) years, during which 5067 (2.5%) participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. After adjusting for lifestyle factors, fish eaters (HR 0.52 [95% CI: 0.39-0.69]) and fish and poultry eaters (HR 0.62 [95% CI: 0.45-0.88]) had a lower risk of incident type 2 diabetes compared with meat eaters. The association for vegetarians was not significant. Varied diet had a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Obesity partially mediated the association of fish (30.6%), fish and poultry (49.8%) and varied (55.2%) diets. Fish eaters, as well as fish and poultry eaters, were at a lower risk of incident type 2 diabetes than meat eaters, partially attributable to lower obesity risk.",2022,diabetes
40931124,Changes in food choices and dietary patterns during the lifestyle intervention and their association with type 2 diabetes risk in participants with high or low genetic risk for type 2 diabetes.,"To investigate how a group-based lifestyle intervention affects food choices and if the dietary patterns at the end of the intervention are associated with incidence type 2 diabetes (T2D). We also investigated if the possible associations between diet and T2D risk were modified by the genetic risk for T2D. Participants in the T2D-GENE study were men with prediabetes aged 50-75 years, body mass index  ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, belonging in either low or high genetic risk score (GRS) tertile for T2D. They participated in a 3 year, group-based T2D-GENE lifestyle study (either an intervention or a control arm). Food consumption was measured with a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline and at year 3. We included in our study all the T2D-GENE participants who had FFQ available at year 3 (n = 883). To diagnose T2D we used the following criteria, fasting plasma glucose  ≥ 7.0 mmol/l, 2 h plasma glucose  ≥ 11.1 mmol/l, or HbA1C  ≥ 48 mmol/mol ( ≥ 6.5%). The GRS was based on 76 genetic variants associated with T2D. There were statistically significant changes towards more recommended food consumption (higher frequency of whole-grain products, vegetables, and non-tropical vegetable oils) in the participants receiving lifestyle counselling as compared to their baseline and to the population controls. The intervention group reported increased consumption of healthy dietary pattern (high in e.g. vegetables, whole-grain products, and fish) and decreased consumption of unhealthy (high in e.g. meat, sausages and low-fibre products) at year three as compared to baseline. End-of-intervention healthy dietary pattern was associated with a decrease in the risk of T2D (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46; 0.97 in multivariable model) and end-of-intervention unhealthy pattern with increased risk (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.26; 2.62 in multivariable model). When stratified by the GRS, the associations remained significant for the high genetic risk group. A group-based lifestyle intervention improved diet quality. Healthy dietary pattern associated with lower risk for T2D whereas unhealthy pattern associated with higher risk. After stratification by the GRS, associations were evident in participants with a high genetic risk for T2D.",2025,diabetes
