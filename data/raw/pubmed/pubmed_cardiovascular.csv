36746187,Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for coronary heart disease: a meta-analysis.,"Coronary heart disease is the most common reason for referral to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) globally. However, the generalizability of previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is questioned. Therefore, a contemporary updated meta-analysis was undertaken. Database and trial registry searches were conducted to September 2020, seeking RCTs of exercise-based interventions with ≥6-month follow-up, compared with no-exercise control for adults with myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or following coronary artery bypass graft, or percutaneous coronary intervention. The outcomes of mortality, recurrent clinical events, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis, and cost-effectiveness data were narratively synthesized. Meta-regression was used to examine effect modification. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A total of 85 RCTs involving 23 430 participants with a median 12-month follow-up were included. Overall, exercise-based CR was associated with significant risk reductions in cardiovascular mortality [risk ratio (RR): 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64-0.86, number needed to treat (NNT): 37], hospitalizations (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.89, NNT: 37), and myocardial infarction (RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.96, NNT: 100). There was some evidence of significantly improved HRQoL with CR participation, and CR is cost-effective. There was no significant impact on overall mortality (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.89-1.04), coronary artery bypass graft (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80-1.15), or percutaneous coronary intervention (RR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.69-1.02). No significant difference in effects was found across different patient groups, CR delivery models, doses, follow-up, or risk of bias. This review confirms that participation in exercise-based CR by patients with coronary heart disease receiving contemporary medical management reduces cardiovascular mortality, recurrent cardiac events, and hospitalizations and provides additional evidence supporting the improvement in HRQoL and the cost-effectiveness of CR.",2023,cardiovascular

26606383,Exercise as medicine - evidence for prescribing exercise as therapy in 26 different chronic diseases.,"This review provides the reader with the up-to-date evidence-based basis for prescribing exercise as medicine in the treatment of 26 different diseases: psychiatric diseases (depression, anxiety, stress, schizophrenia); neurological diseases (dementia, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis); metabolic diseases (obesity, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes); cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, cerebral apoplexy, and claudication intermittent); pulmonary diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis); musculo-skeletal disorders (osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, back pain, rheumatoid arthritis); and cancer. The effect of exercise therapy on disease pathogenesis and symptoms are given and the possible mechanisms of action are discussed. We have interpreted the scientific literature and for each disease, we provide the reader with our best advice regarding the optimal type and dose for prescription of exercise.",2015,cardiovascular
34690044,Arterial hypertension - Clinical trials update 2021.,"This review aims to summarize and discuss some of the most relevant clinical trials in epidemiology, diagnostics, and treatment of hypertension published in 2020 and 2021. The trials included in this review are related to hypertension onset age and risk for future cardiovascular disease, reliability of different blood pressure monitoring methods, role of exercise-induced hypertension, treatment of hypertension in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, management of hypertension high-risk patient groups, e.g., in the elderly (≥80 years) and patients with atrial fibrillation, and the interplay between nutrition and hypertension, as well as recent insights into renal denervation for treatment of hypertension. Hypertension onset age, nighttime blood pressure levels and a riser pattern are relevant for the prognosis of future cardiovascular diseases. The risk of coronary heart disease appears to increase linearly with increasing exercise systolic blood pressure. Renin-angiotensin system blockers are not associated with an increased risk for a severe course of COVID-19. In elderly patients, a risk-benefit assessment of intensified blood pressure control should be individually evaluated. A J-shaped association between cardiovascular disease and achieved blood pressure could also be demonstrated in patients with atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation. Salt restriction and lifestyle modification remain effective options in treating hypertensive patients at low cardiovascular risk. Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists show BP-lowering effects. Renal denervation should be considered as an additional or alternative treatment option in selected patients with uncontrolled hypertension.",2022,cardiovascular
37289900,Physical Activity Over the Lifecourse and Cardiovascular Disease.,"Despite improvements in cardiovascular care in recent decades, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of death worldwide. At its core, CVD is a largely preventable disease with diligent risk factor management and early detection. As highlighted in the American Heart Association's <i>Life's Essential 8</i>, physical activity plays a central role in CVD prevention at an individual and population level. Despite pervasive knowledge of the numerous cardiovascular and noncardiovascular health benefits of physical activity, physical activity has steadily decreased over time and unfavorable changes in physical activity occur throughout people's lives. Here, we use a lifecourse framework to examine the evidence reporting on the association of physical activity with CVD. From in utero to older adults, we review and discuss the evidence detailing how physical activity may prevent incident CVD and mitigate CVD-related morbidity and death across all life stages.",2023,cardiovascular
38243826,Obesity and cardiovascular health.,"Obesity has risen to epidemic levels worldwide over the past few decades and has become a huge global health burden owing to its direct contribution to the development of some of the most prevalent chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and other cardiovascular diseases. Obesity is a disease of positive energy balance resulting from complex interactions between abnormal neurohumoral responses and an individual's socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, and genetic factors leading to a state of chronic inflammation. Understanding the complex nature of the disease is crucial in determining the best approach to combat its rising numbers. Despite recent advancements in pharmacological therapy for the treatment of obesity, reversing weight gain and maintaining weight loss is challenging due to the relapsing nature of the disease. Prevention, therefore, remains the key which needs to start in utero and continued throughout life. This review summarizes the role obesity plays in the pathophysiology of various cardiovascular diseases both by directly affecting endothelial and myocyte function and indirectly by enhancing major cardiovascular risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. We highlight the importance of a holistic approach needed to prevent and treat this debilitating disease. Particularly, we analyse the effects of plant-based diet, regular exercise, and non-exercise activity thermogenesis on obesity and overall cardiorespiratory fitness. Moreover, we discuss the significance of individualizing obesity management with a multimodal approach including lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery to tackle this chronic disease.",2024,cardiovascular
32342456,Exercise and Hypertension.,"Hypertension is a fatal yet preventable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is responsible for majority of cardiovascular mortality. Hypertension is closely associated with inactive lifestyle. Physical activity and/or exercise are shown to delay development of hypertension. Both aerobic and resistance exercise have been proven to reduce blood pressure (BP) effectively. Since brisk walking is an easy, inexpensive, simple, and effective way of exercise, this type of an aerobic workout can be recommended to society. All professional organizations and government bodies recommend moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for at least 30 min on at least 3 days of the week or resistance exercise on 2-3 days of the week. Exercise sessions can either be continuous for 30 min or be composed of at least 10 min of short exercise duration to a daily total of 30 min. After an exercise session, BP decreases, and this decline continues for up to 24 h; which is called post-exercise hypotension. Overall 5 mmHg decrease in BP with regular exercise may be ensured. With a decrease of 5 mmHg in systolic BP, mortality due to coronary heart disease decreases by 9%, mortality due to stroke decreases by 14% and all-cause mortality decreases by 7%. Regular exercise should therefore be recommended for all individuals including normotensives, prehypertensives, and hypertensives.",2020,cardiovascular
37517924,"Peripheral artery disease: Update on etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment.","Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a condition related to atherosclerosis affecting >200 million people worldwide, and it increases cardiovascular morbidity (mainly from myocardial infarction and stroke) and mortality. Indeed, PAD patients are classified as patients at very high cardiovascular risk. The most common manifestation of PAD is intermittent claudication, which is associated with reduced mobility and leg pain. Nevertheless, asymptomatic PAD is the most frequent form of PAD worldwide; therefore, it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. The major risk factors for PAD are smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, overweight/obesity, age, male sex, and black race. Hence, the first and most relevant approach in PAD treatment is lifestyle management, with measures such as smoking cessation, healthy diet, weight loss, and regular physical exercise. This should also be supported by an optimal pharmacological approach including lipid-lowering drugs, antihypertensive drugs, antidiabetic agents, and antithrombotics.",2023,cardiovascular
31492503,"Modifiable risk factors, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in 155 722 individuals from 21 high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries (PURE): a prospective cohort study.","Global estimates of the effect of common modifiable risk factors on cardiovascular disease and mortality are largely based on data from separate studies, using different methodologies. The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study overcomes these limitations by using similar methods to prospectively measure the effect of modifiable risk factors on cardiovascular disease and mortality across 21 countries (spanning five continents) grouped by different economic levels. In this multinational, prospective cohort study, we examined associations for 14 potentially modifiable risk factors with mortality and cardiovascular disease in 155 722 participants without a prior history of cardiovascular disease from 21 high-income, middle-income, or low-income countries (HICs, MICs, or LICs). The primary outcomes for this paper were composites of cardiovascular disease events (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure) and mortality. We describe the prevalence, hazard ratios (HRs), and population-attributable fractions (PAFs) for cardiovascular disease and mortality associated with a cluster of behavioural factors (ie, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, physical activity, and sodium intake), metabolic factors (ie, lipids, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity), socioeconomic and psychosocial factors (ie, education, symptoms of depression), grip strength, and household and ambient pollution. Associations between risk factors and the outcomes were established using multivariable Cox frailty models and using PAFs for the entire cohort, and also by countries grouped by income level. Associations are presented as HRs and PAFs with 95% CIs. Between Jan 6, 2005, and Dec 4, 2016, 155 722 participants were enrolled and followed up for measurement of risk factors. 17 249 (11·1%) participants were from HICs, 102 680 (65·9%) were from MICs, and 35 793 (23·0%) from LICs. Approximately 70% of cardiovascular disease cases and deaths in the overall study population were attributed to modifiable risk factors. Metabolic factors were the predominant risk factors for cardiovascular disease (41·2% of the PAF), with hypertension being the largest (22·3% of the PAF). As a cluster, behavioural risk factors contributed most to deaths (26·3% of the PAF), although the single largest risk factor was a low education level (12·5% of the PAF). Ambient air pollution was associated with 13·9% of the PAF for cardiovascular disease, although different statistical methods were used for this analysis. In MICs and LICs, household air pollution, poor diet, low education, and low grip strength had stronger effects on cardiovascular disease or mortality than in HICs. Most cardiovascular disease cases and deaths can be attributed to a small number of common, modifiable risk factors. While some factors have extensive global effects (eg, hypertension and education), others (eg, household air pollution and poor diet) vary by a country's economic level. Health policies should focus on risk factors that have the greatest effects on averting cardiovascular disease and death globally, with additional emphasis on risk factors of greatest importance in specific groups of countries. Full funding sources are listed at the end of the paper (see Acknowledgments).",2020,cardiovascular
34836431,Obesity and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors: From Childhood to Adulthood.,"Obesity has become a major epidemic in the 21st century. It increases the risk of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, which are known cardiometabolic risk factors and components of the metabolic syndrome. Although overt cardiovascular (CV) diseases such as stroke or myocardial infarction are the domain of adulthood, it is evident that the CV continuum begins very early in life. Recognition of risk factors and early stages of CV damage, at a time when these processes are still reversible, and the development of prevention strategies are major pillars in reducing CV morbidity and mortality in the general population. In this review, we will discuss the role of well-known but also novel risk factors linking obesity and increased CV risk from prenatal age to adulthood, including the role of perinatal factors, diet, nutrigenomics, and nutri-epigenetics, hyperuricemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and cardiorespiratory fitness. The importance of 'tracking' of these risk factors on adult CV health is highlighted and the economic impact of childhood obesity as well as preventive strategies are discussed.",2021,cardiovascular
26746178,"Dietary and Policy Priorities for Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Obesity: A Comprehensive Review.","Suboptimal nutrition is a leading cause of poor health. Nutrition and policy science have advanced rapidly, creating confusion yet also providing powerful opportunities to reduce the adverse health and economic impacts of poor diets. This review considers the history, new evidence, controversies, and corresponding lessons for modern dietary and policy priorities for cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Major identified themes include the importance of evaluating the full diversity of diet-related risk pathways, not only blood lipids or obesity; focusing on foods and overall diet patterns, rather than single isolated nutrients; recognizing the complex influences of different foods on long-term weight regulation, rather than simply counting calories; and characterizing and implementing evidence-based strategies, including policy approaches, for lifestyle change. Evidence-informed dietary priorities include increased fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, legumes, fish, vegetable oils, yogurt, and minimally processed whole grains; and fewer red meats, processed (eg, sodium-preserved) meats, and foods rich in refined grains, starch, added sugars, salt, and trans fat. More investigation is needed on the cardiometabolic effects of phenolics, dairy fat, probiotics, fermentation, coffee, tea, cocoa, eggs, specific vegetable and tropical oils, vitamin D, individual fatty acids, and diet-microbiome interactions. Little evidence to date supports the cardiometabolic relevance of other popular priorities: eg, local, organic, grass-fed, farmed/wild, or non-genetically modified. Evidence-based personalized nutrition appears to depend more on nongenetic characteristics (eg, physical activity, abdominal adiposity, gender, socioeconomic status, culture) than genetic factors. Food choices must be strongly supported by clinical behavior change efforts, health systems reforms, novel technologies, and robust policy strategies targeting economic incentives, schools and workplaces, neighborhood environments, and the food system. Scientific advances provide crucial new insights on optimal targets and best practices to reduce the burdens of diet-related cardiometabolic diseases.",2016,cardiovascular
26139859,Exercise and the cardiovascular system: clinical science and cardiovascular outcomes.,"Substantial evidence has established the value of high levels of physical activity, exercise training (ET), and overall cardiorespiratory fitness in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This article reviews some basics of exercise physiology and the acute and chronic responses of ET, as well as the effect of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness on cardiovascular diseases. This review also surveys data from epidemiological and ET studies in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, particularly coronary heart disease and heart failure. These data strongly support the routine prescription of ET to all patients and referrals for patients with cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary heart disease and heart failure, to specific cardiac rehabilitation and ET programs.",2015,cardiovascular
31825114,"Hypertension in older adults: Assessment, management, and challenges.","Hypertension in older adults is related to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death. The global burden of hypertension is increasing due to an aging population and increasing prevalence of obesity, and is estimated to affect one third of the world's population by 2025. Adverse outcomes in older adults are compounded by mechanical hemodynamic changes, arterial stiffness, neurohormonal and autonomic dysregulation, and declining renal function. This review highlights the current evidence and summarizes recent guidelines on hypertension, pertaining to older adults. Management strategies for hypertension in older adults must consider the degree of frailty, increasingly complex medical comorbidities, and psycho-social factors, and must therefore be individualized. Non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions should be encouraged to mitigate the risk of developing hypertension, and as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the need for medications. Pharmacological therapy with diuretics, renin-angiotensin system blockers, and calcium channel blockers have all shown benefit on cardiovascular outcomes in older patients. Given the economic and public health burden of hypertension in the United States and globally, it is critical to address lifestyle modifications in younger generations to prevent hypertension with age.",2020,cardiovascular
34444726,"Ketogenic Diet, Physical Activity, and Hypertension-A Narrative Review.","Several studies link cardiovascular diseases (CVD) with unhealthy lifestyles (unhealthy dietary habits, alcohol consumption, smoking, and low levels of physical activity). Therefore, the strong need for CVD prevention may be pursued through an improved control of CVD risk factors (impaired lipid and glycemic profiles, high blood pressure, and obesity), which is achievable through an overall intervention aimed to favor a healthy lifestyle. Focusing on diet, different recommendations emphasize the need to increase or avoid consumption of entire classes of food, with only partly known and only partly foreseeable consequences on the overall level of health. In recent years, the ketogenic diet (KD) has been proposed to be an effective lifestyle intervention for metabolic syndrome, and although the beneficial effects on weight loss and glucose metabolism seems to be well established, the effects of a prolonged KD on the ability to perform different types of exercise and the influence of KD on blood pressure (BP) levels, both in normotensives and in hypertensives, are not so well understood. The objective of this review is to analyze, on the basis of current evidence, the relationship between KD, regular physical activity, and BP.",2021,cardiovascular
31553287,"A Brief Review of Cardiovascular Diseases, Associated Risk Factors and Current Treatment Regimes.","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of premature death and disability in humans and their incidence is on the rise globally. Given their substantial contribution towards the escalating costs of health care, CVDs also generate a high socio-economic burden in the general population. The underlying pathogenesis and progression associated with nearly all CVDs are predominantly of atherosclerotic origin that leads to the development of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, venous thromboembolism and, peripheral vascular disease, subsequently causing myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias or stroke. The aetiological risk factors leading to the onset of CVDs are well recognized and include hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking and, lack of physical activity. They collectively represent more than 90% of the CVD risks in all epidemiological studies. Despite high fatality rate of CVDs, the identification and careful prevention of the underlying risk factors can significantly reduce the global epidemic of CVDs. Beside making favorable lifestyle modifications, primary regimes for the prevention and treatment of CVDs include lipid-lowering drugs, antihypertensives, antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapies. Despite their effectiveness, significant gaps in the treatment of CVDs remain. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology and pathology of the major CVDs that are prevalent globally. We also determine the contribution of well-recognized risk factors towards the development of CVDs and the prevention strategies. In the end, therapies for the control and treatment of CVDs are discussed.",2019,cardiovascular
36481212,Updates on obesity and the obesity paradox in cardiovascular diseases.,"The prevalence of obesity has reached pandemic proportions worldwide and certainly in the United States. Obesity is a well-established independent risk factor for development of many cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including heart failure, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. Therefore, it is logical to expect obesity would have a strong correlation with CVD mortality. However, a substantial body of literature demonstrates a paradox with improved prognosis of overweight and obese patients with established CVD compared to lean patients with the identical CVD. Surprisingly, similar data has also shown that cardiovascular fitness, rather than weight loss alone, influences the relationship between obesity and mortality in those with established CVD. The impact of fitness, exercise, physical activity (PA), and weight loss and their relationship to the obesity paradox are all reviewed here.",2023,cardiovascular
30879339,2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease: Executive Summary: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines.,"1. The most important way to prevent atherosclerotic vascular disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation is to promote a healthy lifestyle throughout life. 2. A team-based care approach is an effective strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Clinicians should evaluate the social determinants of health that affect individuals to inform treatment decisions. 3. Adults who are 40 to 75 years of age and are being evaluated for cardiovascular disease prevention should undergo 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimation and have a clinician–patient risk discussion before starting on pharmacological therapy, such as antihypertensive therapy, a statin, or aspirin. The presence or absence of additional risk-enhancing factors can help guide decisions about preventive interventions in select individuals, as can coronary artery calcium scanning. 4. All adults should consume a healthy diet that emphasizes the intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, lean vegetable or animal protein, and fish and minimizes the intake of <i>trans</i> fats, processed meats, refined carbohydrates, and sweetened beverages. For adults with overweight and obesity, counseling and caloric restriction are recommended for achieving and maintaining weight loss. 5. Adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity. 6. For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lifestyle changes, such as improving dietary habits and achieving exercise recommendations are crucial. If medication is indicated, metformin is first-line therapy, followed by consideration of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. 7. All adults should be assessed at every healthcare visit for tobacco use, and those who use tobacco should be assisted and strongly advised to quit. 8. Aspirin should be used infrequently in the routine primary prevention of ASCVD because of lack of net benefit. 9. Statin therapy is first-line treatment for primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (≥190 mg/dL), those with diabetes mellitus, who are 40 to 75 years of age, and those determined to be at sufficient ASCVD risk after a clinician–patient risk discussion. 10. Nonpharmacological interventions are recommended for all adults with elevated blood pressure or hypertension. For those requiring pharmacological therapy, the target blood pressure should generally be <130/80 mm Hg.",2019,cardiovascular
32843206,"Obesity and Coronary Heart Disease: Epidemiology, Pathology, and Coronary Artery Imaging.","Overweight and obesity contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in general and coronary heart disease (CHD) in particular in part by their association with traditional and nontraditional CVD risk factors. Obesity is also considered to be an independent risk factor for CVD. The metabolic syndrome, of which central obesity is an important component, is strongly associated with CVD including CHD. There is abundant epidemiologic evidence of an association between both overweight and obesity and CHD. Evidence from postmortem studies and studies involving coronary artery imaging is less persuasive. Recent studies suggest the presence of an obesity paradox with respect to mortality in persons with established CHD.

32342457,Exercise and Coronary Heart Disease.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) can be obstructive or nonobstructive. Patients with nonobstructive and stable angina pectoris are usually women. Nonobstructive CAD is caused by endothelial dysfunction at the microvascular level, such as cardiac syndrome X and coronary slow flow syndrome. Even if coronary anatomy is nonobstructive, the presence of myocardial ischemia is a major determinant for the exercise program. CAD is a chronic inflammatory disease, and the progression of the disease can lead to a rapid change in the functional capacity of CAD patients. Exercise training is a major component of cardiac rehabilitation and reduces cardiovascular mortality, morbidity, and rehospitalization as well as improves psychological stress and controls risk factors of CAD, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity. It is possible that the quality of life of patients with CAD can be improved by using appropriate exercise therapy. However, the exercise programs among CAD patients are highly underutilized. This chapter will summarize the research progress of exercise in the prevention and treatment of CAD as well as how to create safe exercise programs and the importance of exercise for patients with CAD. In addition, exercise training has fundamental beneficial effects on ischemic and nonischemic heart failure.",2020,cardiovascular
37712135,Lifestyle management of hypertension: International Society of Hypertension position paper endorsed by the World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension.,"Hypertension, defined as persistently elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) >140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at least 90 mmHg (International Society of Hypertension guidelines), affects over 1.5 billion people worldwide. Hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events (e.g. coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke) and death. An international panel of experts convened by the International Society of Hypertension College of Experts compiled lifestyle management recommendations as first-line strategy to prevent and control hypertension in adulthood. We also recommend that lifestyle changes be continued even when blood pressure-lowering medications are prescribed. Specific recommendations based on literature evidence are summarized with advice to start these measures early in life, including maintaining a healthy body weight, increased levels of different types of physical activity, healthy eating and drinking, avoidance and cessation of smoking and alcohol use, management of stress and sleep levels. We also discuss the relevance of specific approaches including consumption of sodium, potassium, sugar, fibre, coffee, tea, intermittent fasting as well as integrated strategies to implement these recommendations using, for example, behaviour change-related technologies and digital tools.",2024,cardiovascular
30399375,Obesity and cardiovascular disease: revisiting an old relationship.,"A wealth of clinical and epidemiological evidence has linked obesity to a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, stroke, atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Obesity can increase CVD morbidity and mortality directly and indirectly. Direct effects are mediated by obesity-induced structural and functional adaptations of the cardiovascular system to accommodate excess body weight, as well as by adipokine effects on inflammation and vascular homeostasis. Indirect effects are mediated by co-existing CVD risk factors such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Adipose tissue (AT) quality and functionality are more relevant aspects for cardiometabolic risk than its total amount. The consequences of maladaptive AT expansion in obesity are local and systemic: the local include inflammation, hypoxia, dysregulated adipokine secretion and impaired mitochondrial function; the systemic comprise insulin resistance, abnormal glucose/lipid metabolism, hypertension, a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state and endothelial dysfunction, all of which provide linking mechanisms for the association between obesity and CVD. The present narrative review summarizes the major pathophysiological links between obesity and CVD (traditional and novel concepts), analyses the heterogeneity of obesity-related cardiometabolic consequences, and provides an overview of the cardiovascular impact of weight loss interventions.",2019,cardiovascular
38852021,Lifestyle factors as determinants of atherosclerotic cardiovascular health.,"A sedentary lifestyle, low levels of physical activity and fitness, poor dietary patterns, and psychosocial stress are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Conversely, engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining optimal fitness levels, adhering to a heart-healthy dietary pattern, effectively managing body weight, ensuring adequate sleep, implementing stress-reduction strategies, and addressing psychosocial risk factors are associated with a reduced risk of ASCVD. This comprehensive review synthesizes current evidence from large observational studies and randomized controlled trials on lifestyle factors as determinants of ASCVD health. It also briefly reviews mechanistic insights into how factors such as low shear stress, increased reactive oxygen species production, chronic inflammation, platelets and coagulation activation, endothelial dysfunction, and sympathetic hyperactivity contribute to the initiation and exacerbation of ASCVD risk factors. These include obesity, hyperglycemia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, subsequently leading to the development and progression of atherosclerosis, ultimately resulting in chronic ASCVD or acute cardiovascular events. To bridge the translational gap between epidemiologic and trial-based evidence and clinical practice, practical recommendations are summarized to facilitate the translation of scientific knowledge into actionable interventions to promote ASCVD health. Acknowledged is the gap between the evidence-based knowledge and adoption within healthcare systems, which remains a crucial objective in advancing cardiovascular health at the population level.",2024,cardiovascular
36178601,Mediterranean Diet and Obesity-related Disorders: What is the Evidence?,"Obesity is a chronic disease, a major public health problem due to its association with non-communicable diseases and all-cause mortality. Indeed, people with obesity are at increased risk for a variety of obesity-related disorders including hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and several cancers. Many popular diets with very different macronutrient composition, including the Mediterranean diet (MD), have been used, proposed, and studied for prevention and management of obesity. In particular, MD has been the subject of countless studies over the years and now boasts a large body of scientific literature. In this review, we aimed to update current knowledge by summarizing the most recent evidence on the effect of MD on obesity and obesity-related disorders. The negative effects of obesity are partly reversed by substantial weight loss that can be achieved with MD, especially when low-calorie and in combination with adequate physical activity. In addition, the composition of MD has been correlated with an excellent effect on reducing dyslipidemia. It also positively modulates the gut microbiota and immune system, significantly decreasing inflammatory mediators, a common ground for many obesity-related disorders. People with obesity are at increased risk for a variety of medical disorders including hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, there is an inevitable need for measures to manage obesity and its related disorders. At this point, MD has been proposed as a valuable nutritional intervention. It is characterized by a high consumption of vegetables, fruit, nuts, cereals, whole grains, and extra virgin olive oil, as well as a moderate consumption of fish and poultry, and a limited intake of sweets, red meat, and dairy products. MD proves to be the healthiest dietary pattern available to tackle obesity and prevent several non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.",2022,cardiovascular
38832505,Forecasting the Burden of Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke in the United States Through 2050-Prevalence of Risk Factors and Disease: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association.,"Cardiovascular disease and stroke are common and costly, and their prevalence is rising. Forecasts on the prevalence of risk factors and clinical events are crucial. Using the 2015 to March 2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and 2015 to 2019 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we estimated trends in prevalence for cardiovascular risk factors based on adverse levels of Life's Essential 8 and clinical cardiovascular disease and stroke. We projected through 2050, overall and by age and race and ethnicity, accounting for changes in disease prevalence and demographics. We estimate that among adults, prevalence of hypertension will increase from 51.2% in 2020 to 61.0% in 2050. Diabetes (16.3% to 26.8%) and obesity (43.1% to 60.6%) will increase, whereas hypercholesterolemia will decline (45.8% to 24.0%). The prevalences of poor diet, inadequate physical activity, and smoking are estimated to improve over time, whereas inadequate sleep will worsen. Prevalences of coronary disease (7.8% to 9.2%), heart failure (2.7% to 3.8%), stroke (3.9% to 6.4%), atrial fibrillation (1.7% to 2.4%), and total cardiovascular disease (11.3% to 15.0%) will rise. Clinical CVD will affect 45 million adults, and CVD including hypertension will affect more than 184 million adults by 2050 (>61%). Similar trends are projected in children. Most adverse trends are projected to be worse among people identifying as American Indian/Alaska Native or multiracial, Black, or Hispanic. The prevalence of many cardiovascular risk factors and most established diseases will increase over the next 30 years. Clinical and public health interventions are needed to effectively manage, stem, and even reverse these adverse trends.",2024,cardiovascular
29340805,Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: an Update.,"Cardiovascular diseases account for nearly one third of all deaths globally. Improving exercise capacity and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) has been an important target to reduce cardiovascular events. In addition, the American Heart Association defined decreased physical activity as the fourth risk factor for coronary artery disease. Multiple large cohort studies have evaluated the impact of CRF on outcomes. In this review, we will discuss the role of CRF in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Recent data suggest that CRF has an important role in reducing not only cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, but also incident myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and stroke. Most recently, its role in cancer prevention started to emerge. CRF protective effects have also been seen in patients with prior comorbidities like prior coronary artery disease, heart failure, depression, end-stage renal disease, and stroke. The prognostic value of CRF has been demonstrated in various patient populations and cardiovascular conditions. Higher CRF is associated with improved survival and decreased incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and other comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.",2018,cardiovascular
27230638,Epidemiology of Obesity and Diabetes and Their Cardiovascular Complications.,"Obesity and diabetes mellitus have reached epidemic proportions in the past few years. During 2011 to 2012, more than one-third of the US population was obese. Although recent trend data indicate that the epidemic has leveled off, prevalence of abdominal obesity continues to rise, especially among adults. As seen for obesity, the past few decades have seen a doubling of the diabetes mellitus incidence with an increasing number of type 2 diabetes mellitus cases being diagnosed in children. Significant racial and ethnic disparities exist in the prevalence and trends of obesity and diabetes mellitus. In general, in both adults and children, non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans seem to be at a high risk than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Secular changes in agricultural policies, diet, food environment, physical activity, and sleep have all contributed to the upward trends in the diabesity epidemic. Despite marginal improvements in physical activity and the US diet, the food environment has changed drastically to an obesogenic one with increased portion sizes and limited access to healthy food choices especially for disadvantaged populations. Interventions that improve the food environment are critical as both obesity and diabetes mellitus raise the risk of cardiovascular disease by ≈2-fold. Among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus, significant sex differences occur in the risk of cardiovascular disease such that diabetes mellitus completely eliminates or attenuates the advantages of being female. Given the substantial burden of obesity and diabetes mellitus, future research efforts should adopt a translational approach to find sustainable and holistic solutions in preventing these costly diseases.",2016,cardiovascular
40077646,Nutrition and Lifestyle Interventions in Managing Dyslipidemia and Cardiometabolic Risk.,"Dyslipidemia, characterized by abnormal blood lipid levels, is a major public health concern due to its association with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and other cardiometabolic disorders. In this context, appropriate nutrition patterns are pivotal as they represent the basic approach for providing a wide range of substantial advantages. The best evidence for dyslipidemia management is offered by the Mediterranean Diet, the Plant-Based Diet, the High-Fiber Diet and the Anti-inflammatory Diet, while the DASH Diet and the Ketogenic Diet have also been shown to target additional pathological features like hypertension and other comorbidities. The bioactive compounds that are enriched in these nutrition patterns and able to manage dyslipidemia include monounsaturated fatty acids such as ω-3, polyphenols such as oleuropein, resveratrol, flavonoids, and catechins, carotenoids, phytosterols and soluble and unsoluble fibers. Diets rich in these compounds can improve lipid profile by mitigating oxidative stress, reducing low-grade chronic inflammation, modulating macronutrient absorption and other mechanisms, thereby supporting cardiovascular health. Additionally, lifestyle interventions such as regular physical activity, weight loss, reduced alcohol consumption and smoking cessation further ameliorate lipid metabolism and manage circulated lipid profile. Furthermore, emerging insights from nutrigenomics underscore the potential for proper diet to address genetic factors and optimize treatment outcomes. The pivotal role of nutrition interventions in the context of dyslipidemia and its cardiometabolic implications is discussed in this review, emphasizing evidence-based and personalized approaches.",2025,cardiovascular
34333589,Association between adiposity and cardiovascular outcomes: an umbrella review and meta-analysis of observational and Mendelian randomization studies.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the causal relationship and evidence of an association between increased adiposity and the risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events or mortality. Observational (informing association) and Mendelian randomization (MR) (informing causality) studies were assessed to gather mutually complementary insights and elucidate perplexing epidemiological relationships. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational and MR studies that were published until January 2021 and evaluated the association between obesity-related indices and CVD risk were searched. Twelve systematic reviews with 53 meta-analyses results (including over 501 cohort studies) and 12 MR studies were included in the analysis. A body mass index (BMI) increase was associated with higher risks of coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, all-cause stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic stroke, hypertension, aortic valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism, and venous thrombo-embolism. The MR study results demonstrated a causal effect of obesity on all indices but stroke. The CVD risk increase for every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI varied from 10% [relative risk (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.21; certainty of evidence, low] for haemorrhagic stroke to 49% (RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.40-1.60; certainty of evidence, high) for hypertension. The all-cause and CVD-specific mortality risks increased with adiposity in cohorts, but the MR studies demonstrated no causal effect of adiposity on all-cause mortality. High adiposity is associated with increased CVD risk despite divergent evidence gradients. Adiposity was a causal risk factor for CVD except all-cause mortality and stroke. Half (49%; 26/53) of the associations were supported by high-level evidence. The associations were consistent between sexes and across global regions. This study provides guidance on how to integrate evidence from observational (association) and genetics-driven (causation) studies accumulated to date, to enable a more reliable interpretation of epidemiological relationships.",2021,cardiovascular
37582455,Role of Yoga in Cardiovascular Diseases.,"Cardiovascular diseases are a collection of conditions that affect the blood vessels and the heart. These conditions include cardiac rehabilitation, hypertension, cardiac failure, rheumatic heart disease, peripheral artery disease, and coronary heart disease. Poor nutrition, alcohol, lack of exercise, smoking, etc are the main behavioral risk factors for heart disease. This study delivers a methodical review of yoga's role in the management and inhibition of cardiovascular diseases and their associated risk factors. This review suggests that proper maintenance of fitness and stress employing yoga effectively lowers cardiovascular disease. In this review, various asanas, and pranayama like Marjaryasana, Kapalabhati, Halasana, etc have been discussed. Also, their role in the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). In addition to this different metabolic syndrome associated with cardiovascular diseases and the relation of yoga with hypertension has been discussed. The review has documented satisfactory proof and concludes that yogic exercise enhances cardiovascular health and reduces associated risk factors.",2024,cardiovascular
36293177,"Hypertension Related to Obesity: Pathogenesis, Characteristics and Factors for Control.","The World Health Organization (WHO) refers to obesity as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a health risk. Obesity was first designated as a disease in 2012 and since then the cost and the burden of the disease have witnessed a worrisome increase. Obesity and hypertension are closely interrelated as abdominal obesity interferes with the endocrine and immune systems and carries a greater risk for insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Many factors are at the interplay between obesity and hypertension. They include hemodynamic alterations, oxidative stress, renal injury, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance, sleep apnea syndrome and the leptin-melanocortin pathway. Genetics, epigenetics, and mitochondrial factors also play a major role. The measurement of blood pressure in obese patients requires an adapted cuff and the search for other secondary causes is necessary at higher thresholds than the general population. Lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise are often not enough to control obesity, and so far, bariatric surgery constitutes the most reliable method to achieve weight loss. Nonetheless, the emergence of new agents such as Semaglutide and Tirzepatide offers promising alternatives. Finally, several molecular pathways are actively being explored, and they should significantly extend the treatment options available.",2022,cardiovascular
30190007,Prevention and Control of Hypertension: JACC Health Promotion Series.,"Hypertension, the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, originates from combined genetic, environmental, and social determinants. Environmental factors include overweight/obesity, unhealthy diet, excessive dietary sodium, inadequate dietary potassium, insufficient physical activity, and consumption of alcohol. Prevention and control of hypertension can be achieved through targeted and/or population-based strategies. For control of hypertension, the targeted strategy involves interventions to increase awareness, treatment, and control in individuals. Corresponding population-based strategies involve interventions designed to achieve a small reduction in blood pressure (BP) in the entire population. Having a usual source of care, optimizing adherence, and minimizing therapeutic inertia are associated with higher rates of BP control. The Chronic Care Model, a collaborative partnership among the patient, provider, and health system, incorporates a multilevel approach for control of hypertension. Optimizing the prevention, recognition, and care of hypertension requires a paradigm shift to team-based care and the use of strategies known to control BP.",2018,cardiovascular
34110910,Contemporary Medical Management of Peripheral Artery Disease.,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis. Modifiable risk factors including cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes, poor diet quality, obesity, and physical inactivity, along with underlying genetic factors contribute to lower extremity atherosclerosis. Patients with PAD often have coexistent coronary or cerebrovascular disease, and increased likelihood of major adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. Patients with PAD often have reduced walking capacity and are at risk of acute and chronic critical limb ischemia leading to major adverse limb events, such as peripheral revascularization or amputation. The presence of polyvascular disease identifies the highest risk patient group for major adverse cardiovascular events, and patients with prior critical limb ischemia, prior lower extremity revascularization, or amputation have a heightened risk of major adverse limb events. Medical therapies have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events, and improving function in patients with PAD by modulating key disease determining pathways including inflammation, vascular dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. Treatment with guideline-recommended therapies, including smoking cessation, lipid lowering drugs, optimal glucose control, and antithrombotic medications lowers the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events. Exercise training and cilostazol improve walking capacity. The heterogeneity of risk profile in patients with PAD supports a personalized approach, with consideration of treatment intensification in those at high risk of adverse events. This review highlights the medical therapies currently available to improve outcomes in patients with PAD.",2021,cardiovascular

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were calculated using random-effects models. We identified 29 articles. The RR for the highest versus the lowest category of the MDS was 0.81 (95% CI 0.74-0.88) for the 11 studies that considered unspecified CVD, consistent across all strata. The corresponding pooled RR for CHD/AMI risk was 0.70 (95% CI 0.62-0.80), based on 11 studies. The inverse relationship was consistent across strata of study design, end point (incidence and mortality), sex, geographic area, and the MDS used. The overall RR for the six studies that considered unspecified stroke was 0.73 (95% CI 0.59-0.91) for the highest versus the lowest category of the MDS. The corresponding values were 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.92) for ischemic (five studies) and 1.01 (95% CI 0.74-1.37) for hemorrhagic stroke (four studies). Our findings indicate and further quantify that MD exerts a protective effect on the risk of CVD. This inverse association includes CHD and ischemic stroke, but apparently not hemorrhagic stroke.",2019,cardiovascular
36990505,Comparison of seven popular structured dietary programmes and risk of mortality and major cardiovascular events in patients at increased cardiovascular risk: systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"To determine the relative efficacy of structured named diet and health behaviour programmes (dietary programmes) for prevention of mortality and major cardiovascular events in patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), Embase, Medline, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched up to September 2021. Randomised trials of patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease that compared dietary programmes with minimal intervention (eg, healthy diet brochure) or alternative programmes with at least nine months of follow-up and reporting on mortality or major cardiovascular events (such as stroke or non-fatal myocardial infarction). In addition to dietary intervention, dietary programmes could also include exercise, behavioural support, and other secondary interventions such as drug treatment. All cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and individual cardiovascular events (stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and unplanned cardiovascular interventions). Pairs of reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A random effects network meta-analysis was performed using a frequentist approach and grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) methods to determine the certainty of evidence for each outcome. 40 eligible trials were identified with 35 548 participants across seven named dietary programmes (low fat, 18 studies; Mediterranean, 12; very low fat, 6; modified fat, 4; combined low fat and low sodium, 3; Ornish, 3; Pritikin, 1). At last reported follow-up, based on moderate certainty evidence, Mediterranean dietary programmes proved superior to minimal intervention for the prevention of all cause mortality (odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 0.92; patients at intermediate risk: risk difference 17 fewer per 1000 followed over five years), cardiovascular mortality (0.55, 0.39 to 0.78; 13 fewer per 1000), stroke (0.65, 0.46 to 0.93; 7 fewer per 1000), and non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.48, 0.36 to 0.65; 17 fewer per 1000). Based on moderate certainty evidence, low fat programmes proved superior to minimal intervention for prevention of all cause mortality (0.84, 0.74 to 0.95; 9 fewer per 1000) and non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.77, 0.61 to 0.96; 7 fewer per 1000). The absolute effects for both dietary programmes were more pronounced for patients at high risk. There were no convincing differences between Mediterranean and low fat programmes for mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction. The five remaining dietary programmes generally had little or no benefit compared with minimal intervention typically based on low to moderate certainty evidence. Moderate certainty evidence shows that programmes promoting Mediterranean and low fat diets, with or without physical activity or other interventions, reduce all cause mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients with increased cardiovascular risk. Mediterranean programmes are also likely to reduce stroke risk. Generally, other named dietary programmes were not superior to minimal intervention. PROSPERO CRD42016047939.",2023,cardiovascular
40293220,Leptin and Associated Neural Pathways Underlying Obesity-Induced Hypertension.,"Obesity rates have surged to pandemic levels, placing tremendous burden on our society. This chronic and complex disease is related to the development of many life-threatening illnesses including cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension caused by obesity increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity by promoting stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and end-stage renal disease. Overwhelming evidence supports neural origins for obesity-induced hypertension and pinpoints the adipose-derived hormone, leptin, and the sympathetic nervous system as major causal factors. Hyperleptinemia in obesity is associated with selective leptin resistance where leptin's renal sympathoexcitatory and pressor effects are preserved while the metabolic actions are impaired. Understanding the mechanisms driving this phenomenon is critical for developing effective therapeutics. This review describes the neural mechanisms of obesity-induced hypertension with a focus on the molecular and neuronal substrates of leptin action.",2025,cardiovascular

Thus, there is a growing necessity of improving a personalized nutrition to treat obesity and associated medical conditions, taking into account the interactions between diet, genes and health. Therefore, the knowledge of the interactions between the genome and nutrients at the molecular level, has led to the advent of nutritional genomics, which involves the sciences of nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics.

Genetic mutations cause a small proportion (1-2%) of early-onset AD, with mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2). Major contributing factors of late-onset AD are ApoE4 genotype, traumatic brain injury, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular conditions, in addition to lifestyle factors, such as unhealthy diet and lack of physical exercise. Disease progression can be delayed and/or prevented to a greater extent by adopting healthy lifestyle with balanced and antioxidant enriched diet and daily exercise. The interaction and interplay of diet, exercise, age, and pharmacological interventions holds a crucial role in the progression, pathogenesis and management of AD and its comorbidities, including diabetes, obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular conditions. Antioxidant enriched diet contributes to brain health, glucose control, weight management, and cardiovascular well-being. Regular exercise removes toxins including free radicals and enhances insulin sensitivity, and supports cardiovascular function. In the current article, we discussed, the role of diet, and exercise in aging, AD and other conditions including diabetes, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular conditions.

Importantly, obesity is not only preventable but can be treated, particularly with lifestyle modifications to forestall T2DM in those with excess adiposity. The mechanisms linking obesity to T2DM are numerous and involve adipose tissue remodeling as a result of unhealthy behaviors, including unhealthy diet, reduced physical activity (PA) and exercise training (ET), and increased sedentary behaviors. Taken together, these factors markedly reduce cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), one of the strongest predictors for cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality in the general population, but also in those with T2DM. In this review we describe the mechanisms leading to adipose tissue remodeling resulting in obesity, as well as the mechanisms linking excess adiposity to insulin resistance and, in turn, T2DM. We then present the therapeutic strategies that can be implemented in obesity to prevent T2DM, with a brief discussion on weight loss, and greater emphasis on PA and ET. We finally present the evidence to support the beneficial effects of such strategies in patients with established T2DM and discuss the importance of achieving improvements in CRF in this population to potentially improve clinical outcomes.",2019,cardiovascular
37308902,Metabolomic phenotyping of obesity for profiling cardiovascular and ocular diseases.,"We aimed to evaluate the impacts of metabolomic body mass index (metBMI) phenotypes on the risks of cardiovascular and ocular diseases outcomes. This study included cohorts in UK and Guangzhou, China. By leveraging the serum metabolome and BMI data from UK Biobank, this study developed and validated a metBMI prediction model using a ridge regression model among 89,830 participants based on 249 metabolites. Five obesity phenotypes were obtained by metBMI and actual BMI (actBMI): normal weight (NW, metBMI of 18.5-24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight (OW, metBMI of 25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), obesity (OB, metBMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overestimated (OE, metBMI-actBMI > 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and underestimated (UE, metBMI-actBMI < - 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Additional participants from the Guangzhou Diabetes Eye Study (GDES) were included for validating the hypothesis. Outcomes included all-cause and cardiovascular (CVD)-cause mortality, as well as incident CVD (coronary heart disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction [MI], and stroke) and age-related eye diseases (age-related macular degeneration [AMD], cataracts, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy [DR]). In the UKB, although OE group had lower actBMI than NW group, the OE group had a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality than those in NW prediction group (HR, 1.68; 95% CI 1.16-2.43). Similarly, the OE group had a 1.7-3.6-fold higher risk than their NW counterparts for cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and coronary heart disease (all P < 0.05). In addition, risk of age-related macular denegation (HR, 1.96; 95% CI 1.02-3.77) was significantly higher in OE group. In the contrast, UE and OB groups showed similar risks of mortality and of cardiovascular and age-related eye diseases (all P > 0.05), though the UE group had significantly higher actBMI than OB group. In the GDES cohort, we further confirmed the potential of metabolic BMI (metBMI) fingerprints for risk stratification of cardiovascular diseases using a different metabolomic approach. Gaps of metBMI and actBMI identified novel metabolic subtypes, which exhibit distinctive cardiovascular and ocular risk profiles. The groups carrying obesity-related metabolites were at higher risk of mortality and morbidity than those with normal health metabolites.

35793739,"Irisin, an exercise-induced bioactive peptide beneficial for health promotion during aging process.","Irisin is an exercise-induced myokine expressed as a bioactive peptide in multiple tissues and organs, and exercise and cold exposure are the major inducers for its secretion. Irisin presents a decreasing trend with the extension of age and is also closely associated with a wide range of aging-related diseases. Currently, many studies on irisin are being conducted with respect to physiological functions for health promotion, and the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of chronic diseases, as well as mechanisms associated with improving energy metabolic balance, enhancing cellular homeostasis by optimizing autophagy, promoting mitochondrial quality control, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitigating inflammatory responses.

36662542,Fibrin clot properties in cardiovascular disease: from basic mechanisms to clinical practice.,"Fibrinogen conversion into insoluble fibrin and the formation of a stable clot is the final step of the coagulation cascade. Fibrin clot porosity and its susceptibility to plasmin-mediated lysis are the key fibrin measures, describing the properties of clots prepared ex vivo from citrated plasma. Cardiovascular disease (CVD), referring to coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and hypertension, has been shown to be associated with the formation of dense fibrin networks that are relatively resistant to lysis. Denser fibrin mesh characterized acute patients at the onset of myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, while hypofibrinolysis has been identified as a persistent fibrin feature in patients following thrombotic events or in those with stable coronary artery disease. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, obesity, and hypertension, have also been linked with unfavourably altered fibrin clot properties, while some lifestyle modifications and pharmacological treatment, in particular statins and anticoagulants, may improve fibrin structure and function. Prospective studies have suggested that prothrombotic fibrin clot phenotype can predict cardiovascular events in short- and long-term follow-ups. Mutations and splice variants of the fibrinogen molecule that have been proved to be associated with thrombophilia or increased cardiovascular risk, along with fibrinogen post-translational modifications, prothrombotic state, inflammation, platelet activation, and neutrophil extracellular traps formation, contribute also to prothrombotic fibrin clot phenotype. Moreover, about 500 clot-bound proteins have been identified within plasma fibrin clots, including fibronectin, α2-antiplasmin, factor XIII, complement component C3, and histidine-rich glycoprotein. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the mechanisms underlying unfavourable fibrin clot properties and their implications in CVD and its thrombo-embolic manifestations.",2023,cardiovascular
28958324,Physical Activity and Mortality in Patients With Stable Coronary Heart Disease.,"Recommendations for physical activity in patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD) are based on modest evidence.

Associations between the volume of habitual exercise in metabolic equivalents of task hours/week and adverse outcomes during a median follow-up of 3.7 years were evaluated. A graded decrease in mortality occurred with increased habitual exercise that was steeper at lower compared with higher exercise levels. Doubling exercise volume was associated with lower all-cause mortality (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79 to 0.85; adjusting for covariates, HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.93). These associations were similar for cardiovascular mortality (unadjusted HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.80 to 0.87; adjusted HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.96), but myocardial infarction and stroke were not associated with exercise volume after adjusting for covariates. The association between decrease in mortality and greater physical activity was stronger in the subgroup of patients at higher risk estimated by the ABC-CHD (Age, Biomarkers, Clinical-Coronary Heart Disease) risk score (p for interaction = 0.0007). In patients with stable CHD, more physical activity was associated with lower mortality.

37843942,Hypertension in Adults: Initial Evaluation and Management.,"Hypertension is a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the most common chronic condition seen by family physicians. Treatment of hypertension reduces morbidity and mortality due to coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. The use of ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring improves diagnostic accuracy. Assessment of adults with hypertension should focus on identifying complications of the condition and comorbid cardiovascular risk factors. Physicians should counsel all patients with elevated blood pressure about effective lifestyle interventions, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, dietary sodium restriction, potassium enrichment, regular exercise, weight loss, and moderation of alcohol consumption. First-line antihypertensive medications include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. Thresholds for pharmacologic intervention and blood pressure goals differ according to various guidelines. Evidence strongly supports reducing blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg to reduce the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in adults with hypertension. Lowering blood pressure to less than 135/85 mm Hg may further reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. Clinical judgment and shared decision-making should guide treatment of patients with mild hypertension and older adults who may be more susceptible to adverse effects of antihypertensive medications and tight blood pressure control.",2023,cardiovascular
36183084,Association between healthy lifestyle and the occurrence of cardiometabolic multimorbidity in hypertensive patients: a prospective cohort study of UK Biobank.,"Cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) is becoming increasingly common in patients with hypertension, and it is well established that healthy lifestyle plays a key role in the prevention of hypertension. However, the association between combined lifestyle factors and CMM in patients with hypertension is uncertain. This prospective analysis included the data (obtained from the UK biobank) of participants with hypertension who did not have coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, or diabetes. The outcome was the occurrence of CMM, defined as ≥ 1 disease of CHD, stroke, and diabetes that occurred in participants with hypertension. Four lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical activity) were assessed using a weighted healthy lifestyle score, and participants were divided into four groups: the very unhealthy, unhealthy, healthy, and very healthy groups. The flexible parameter Royston-Parmar proportional hazard model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) between lifestyles and CMM, as well as the difference in CMM-free life expectancy. During a median follow-up of 12.2 years, 9812 (18.4%) of the 53,397 hypertensive patients occurred CMM. Compared with the very unhealthy group, the very healthy group had a 41% reduction in the risk for CMM in hypertensive patients and a 32-50% reduction in the risk for specific cardiometabolic diseases such as CHD, stroke, and diabetes. For each lifestyle factor, non-smoking had the greatest protective effect against CMM (HR: 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60-0.68). A lifestyle combining multiple healthy factors extended CMM-free life expectancy (e.g., six years longer at age 45 years for participants in the very healthy group). Combined healthy lifestyle factors were associated with a lower risk for CMM in hypertensive patients. This suggests that combined healthy lifestyle should be supported to decrease disease burden.",2022,cardiovascular

However, according to the Annual Report on Cardiovascular Health and Diseases in China published in this article, which was organized and summarized by National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, there is still a huge population living with risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and the morbidity and mortality of CVD are increasing. It is estimated that there are around 330 million patients suffering from CVD currently, including 245 million of hypertension, 13 million of stroke, 45.3 million of peripheral artery disease, 11.39 million of coronary heart disease (CHD), 8.9 million of heart failure, 5 million of pulmonary heart disease, 4.87 million of atrial fibrillation, 2.5 million of rheumatic heart disease, and 2 million of congenital heart disease. Tobacco use, diet and nutrition factors, physical activity, overweight and obesity, and psychological factors are what affect cardiovascular health, while hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, and air pollution are the risk factors for CVD. In this article, in addition to risk factors for CVD, we also report the epidemiological trends of CVD, including CHD, cerebrovascular disease, arrhythmias, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, pulmonary vascular disease and venous thromboembolism, and aortic and peripheral artery diseases, as well as the basic research and medical device development in CVD.

Thus, the purpose of this systematic review was to provide an update on the association between PA and onset of obesity, CHD, diabetes and hypertension in individuals aged ≥18 years who were free of the respective conditions at baseline. We systematically searched OVID, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases for pertinent literature published between January of 2012 and February of 2019. To ensure that conclusions are based on high quality evidence, we only included longitudinal studies conducted in samples of ≥500 participants and with ≥5 years of follow-up. The search yielded 8929 records of which 26 were included in this review. Three studies were conducted on the outcome of incident obesity, eight on incident CHD, nine on incident diabetes, four on incident hypertension, one on the outcome of both diabetes and hypertension, and one on the outcome of CHD, diabetes and hypertension. Overall, there was an association between PA and lower risk of incident obesity, CHD and diabetes, but not hypertension. Higher levels or amount of PA were associated with a reduced risk of new onset of the respective diseases in 20 studies (77%). Whereas four studies reported an elevated risk of incidence of diseases with lower PA levels (15%). PA was not associated with incidence of diseases in two studies (8%). Higher levels of PA are likely associated with a lower risk of becoming obese, develop CHD or diabetes. These findings replicate and strengthen conclusions from earlier reviews underlining the importance of promoting PA in adults. The associations between PA and incident hypertension were less consistent. More research, particularly using prospective cohort designs in large population-based samples, is needed to further untangle the association between PA and incident hypertension.

34538096,Weight-Loss Strategies for Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,"Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and renal diseases in the United States and worldwide. Obesity accounts for much of the risk for primary hypertension through several mechanisms, including neurohormonal activation, inflammation, and kidney dysfunction. As the prevalence of obesity continues to increase, hypertension and associated cardiorenal diseases will also increase unless more effective strategies to prevent and treat obesity are developed. Lifestyle modification, including diet, reduced sedentariness, and increased physical activity, is usually recommended for patients with obesity; however, the long-term success of these strategies for reducing adiposity, maintaining weight loss, and reducing blood pressure has been limited. Effective pharmacotherapeutic and procedural strategies, including metabolic surgeries, are additional options to treat obesity and prevent or attenuate obesity hypertension, target organ damage, and subsequent disease. Medications can be useful for short- and long-term obesity treatment; however, prescription of these drugs is limited. Metabolic surgery is effective for producing sustained weight loss and for treating hypertension and metabolic disorders in many patients with severe obesity. Unanswered questions remain related to the mechanisms of obesity-related diseases, long-term efficacy of different treatment and prevention strategies, and timing of these interventions to prevent obesity and hypertension-mediated target organ damage. Further investigation, including randomized controlled trials, is essential to addressing these questions, and emphasis should be placed on the prevention of obesity to reduce the burden of hypertensive cardiovascular and kidney diseases and subsequent mortality.",2021,cardiovascular

Many studies have shown that both impaired quantity and quality of sleep, particularly with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and comorbid sleep disorders, are associated with incident cardiometabolic consequences. OSA is associated with repetitive episodes of altered blood gases, arousals, large negative swings in intrathoracic pressures, and increased sympathetic activity. Recent studies show that OSA is also associated with altered gut microbiota, which could contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. OSA has been associated with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke, and excess cardiovascular mortality. Association of OSA with chronic obstructive lung disease (overlap syndrome) and morbid obesity (obesity hypoventilation syndrome) increases the odds of mortality.",2024,cardiovascular
33758927,Personalized exercise prescription in the prevention and treatment of arterial hypertension: a Consensus Document from the European Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC) and the ESC Council on Hypertension.,"Treatment of hypertension and its complications remains a major ongoing health care challenge. Around 25% of heart attacks in Europe are already attributed to hypertension and by 2025 up to 60% of the population will have hypertension. Physical inactivity has contributed to the rising prevalence of hypertension, but patients who exercise or engage in physical activity reduce their risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality. Hence, current international guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention provide generic advice to increase aerobic activity, but physiological responses differ with blood pressure (BP) level, and greater reductions in BP across a population may be achievable with more personalized advice. We performed a systematic review of meta-analyses to determine whether there was sufficient evidence for a scientific Consensus Document reporting how exercise prescription could be personalized for BP control. The document discusses the findings of 34 meta-analyses on BP-lowering effects of aerobic endurance training, dynamic resistance training as well as isometric resistance training in patients with hypertension, high-normal, and individuals with normal BP. As a main finding, there was sufficient evidence from the meta-review, based on the estimated range of exercise-induced BP reduction, the number of randomized controlled trials, and the quality score, to propose that type of exercise can be prescribed according to initial BP level, although considerable research gaps remain. Therefore, this evidence-based Consensus Document proposes further work to encourage and develop more frequent use of personalized exercise prescription to optimize lifestyle interventions for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.",2022,cardiovascular

These data, plus the well-documented anti-aging effects of exercise, have likely contributed to the escalating numbers of adults who have embraced the notion that ""more exercise is better."" As a result, worldwide participation in endurance training, competitive long distance endurance events, and high-intensity interval training has increased markedly since the previous American Heart Association statement on exercise risk. On the other hand, vigorous physical activity, particularly when performed by unfit individuals, can acutely increase the risk of sudden cardiac death and acute myocardial infarction in susceptible people. Recent studies have also shown that large exercise volumes and vigorous intensities are both associated with potential cardiac maladaptations, including accelerated coronary artery calcification, exercise-induced cardiac biomarker release, myocardial fibrosis, and atrial fibrillation. The relationship between these maladaptive responses and physical activity often forms a U- or reverse J-shaped dose-response curve. This scientific statement discusses the cardiovascular and health implications for moderate to vigorous physical activity, as well as high-volume, high-intensity exercise regimens, based on current understanding of the associated risks and benefits. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with updated information to advise patients on appropriate preparticipation screening and the benefits and risks of physical activity or physical exertion in varied environments and during competitive events.",2020,cardiovascular
26045020,Summary of the evidence on modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia: A population-based perspective.,"An estimated 47 million people worldwide are living with dementia in 2015, and this number is projected to triple by 2050. In the absence of a disease-modifying treatment or cure, reducing the risk of developing dementia takes on added importance.

This report is a summary of the Association's evaluation, which was presented at the October 2014 WDC meeting. The Association believes there is sufficient evidence to support the link between several modifiable risk factors and a reduced risk for cognitive decline, and sufficient evidence to suggest that some modifiable risk factors may be associated with reduced risk of dementia. Specifically, the Association believes there is sufficiently strong evidence, from a population-based perspective, to conclude that regular physical activity and management of cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, obesity, smoking, and hypertension) reduce the risk of cognitive decline and may reduce the risk of dementia. The Association also believes there is sufficiently strong evidence to conclude that a healthy diet and lifelong learning/cognitive training may also reduce the risk of cognitive decline.",2015,cardiovascular
34237696,"Healthful plant-based dietary patterns, genetic risk of obesity, and cardiovascular risk in the UK biobank study.","People with a higher genetic risk for obesity are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD), and healthy plant-based dietary patterns may be associated with decreased risks of obesity and cardiovascular events. We investigated whether adherence to healthy plant-foods-rich dietary patterns might attenuate risks of obesity and related cardiovascular abnormalities for people at genetically higher risk of obesity. This study included 121,799 middle-aged adults in UK Biobank who were initially free of metabolic diseases and cancer. We calculated a healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) based on 17 major food groups as well as a genetic risk score (GRS) for obesity consisting of body mass index (BMI)-associated variants. The incidence of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, MI, or stroke) was prospectively followed during a mean (SD) 5.1 (0.9) years. We found significant interactions between GRS and hPDI on adiposity (P<sub>interaction</sub> <0.0001); adherence to hPDI was more strongly associated with lower levels of adiposity among participants with higher GRS than those with lower GRS. Further, we found a similar pattern of GRS-hPDI interactions on untreated hypertension (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.0036). When we tested GRS-hPDI interactions on cardiovascular events, adherence to hPDI was more strongly associated with a decreased risk of MI among people with high GRS (above median) than those with low GRS (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.006). Among participants with high GRS, high adherence to hPDI (the top tertile of hPDI) was associated with an HR 0.54 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.74) for MI, as compared to low adherence. Adherence to healthy plant-based dietary patterns significantly attenuated risks of cardiovascular abnormalities for people at genetically higher risk of obesity. Our results support the precision medicine strategies considering genetics and dietary habits to modify cardiovascular health for people at higher risk of genetically determined obesity.",2021,cardiovascular

Univariate Mendelian Randomization (MR), multivariate MR, and mediation MR analyses were used to investigate the causal association between 42 modifiable risk factors and ED. Combined results were pooled from two independent ED genome-wide association studies to verify the findings. Genetically predicted body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, trunk fat mass, whole body fat mass, poor overall health rating, type 2 diabetes, basal metabolic rate, adiponectin, cigarette consumption, insomnia, snoring, hypertension, stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and major depressive disorder were found to increase the risk of ED (all P < 0.05). Additionally, genetic liability to higher body fat percentage and alcohol consumption were suggestively associated with an increased risk of ED (P < 0.05 and adjusted P > 0.05). Genetic predisposition to higher sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels could decrease the risk of ED (P < 0.05). No significant association was detected between lipid levels and ED. Multivariate MR identified type 2 diabetes, basal metabolic rate, cigarette consumption, hypertension, and coronary heart disease as risk factors for ED. The combined results confirmed that waist circumference, whole body fat mass, poor overall health rating, type 2 diabetes, basal metabolic rate, adiponectin, cigarette consumption, snoring, hypertension, ischemic stroke, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and major depressive disorder could increase the risk of ED (all P < 0.05), while higher SHBG decreased the risk of ED (P = 0.004). There were suggestive significances of BMI, insomnia, and stroke on ED (P < 0.05 and adjusted P > 0.05). This comprehensive MR study supported the causal role of obesity, type 2 diabetes, basal metabolic rate, poor self-health rating, cigarette and alcohol consumption, insomnia and snoring, depression, hypertension, stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, SHBG, and adiponectin in the onset and development of ED.",2024,cardiovascular
28150485,Obesity and cardiovascular diseases.,"Obesity is increasingly more common in postindustrial societies, and the burden of childhood obesity is increasing. The major effects of obesity on cardiovascular (CV) health are mediated through the risk of metabolic syndrome (insulin-resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension), such that an absence of these risk factors in obese individuals may not be associated with increased mortality risk. In individuals already diagnosed with chronic CV disease (CVD), the overweight and class I obese have significant associations with improved survival. However, this effect is attenuated by increases in cardiorespiratory fitness. The negative effects of obesity on CV health manifest as accelerated progression of atherosclerosis, higher rates of ventricular remodeling and a higher risk of associated diseases, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. The most effective therapies at reversing CVD risk factors associated with obesity have been dietary changes with exercise, especially through structured exercise programs, such as cardiac rehabilitation.",2017,cardiovascular

Short sleep duration was associated with a higher risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, stroke, and coronary heart disease (CHD) in observational studies, while a causal role was only demonstrated in obesity, hypertension, and CHD by MR. Similarly, long sleep duration showed connections with a higher risk of obesity, T2D, hypertension, stroke, and CHD in observational studies, none was supported by MR analysis. Both observational and MR studies indicated heightened risks of hypertension, stroke, and CHD in relation to insomnia. Napping was linked to elevated risks of T2D and CHD in observational studies, with MR analysis confirming a causal role in T2D. Additionally, snoring was correlated with increased risks of stroke and CHD in both observational and MR studies.

Known modifiable risk factors for CVD include smoking, overweight and obesity, diabetes, elevated blood pressure or hypertension, dyslipidemia, lack of physical activity, and unhealthy diet. Adults who adhere to national guidelines for a healthy diet and physical activity have lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than those who do not. All persons, regardless of their CVD risk status, benefit from healthy eating behaviors and appropriate physical activity. To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet and physical activity for CVD prevention in adults with cardiovascular risk factors. This recommendation statement applies to adults 18 years or older with known hypertension or elevated blood pressure, those with dyslipidemia, or those who have mixed or multiple risk factors such as metabolic syndrome or an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% or greater. Adults with other known modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as abnormal blood glucose levels, obesity, and smoking are not included in this recommendation.

29803897,Uric acid and cardiovascular disease.,"Uric acid (UA) is an end product of purine metabolism in humans and great apes. UA acts as an antioxidant and it accounts for 50% of the total antioxidant capacity of biological fluids in humans. When present in cytoplasm of the cells or in acidic/hydrophobic milieu in atherosclerotic plaques, UA converts into a pro-oxidant agent and promotes oxidative stress and through this mechanism participates in the pathophysiology of human disease including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most epidemiological studies but not all of them suggested the existence of an association between elevated serum UA level and CVD, including coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, congestive heart failure, arterial hypertension and atrial fibrillation as well as an increased risk for mortality due to CVD in general population and subjects with confirmed CHD. Evidence available also suggests an association between elevated UA and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease. Experimental and clinical studies have evidenced several mechanisms through which elevated UA level exerts deleterious effects on cardiovascular health including increased oxidative stress, reduced availability of nitric oxide and endothelial dysfunction, promotion of local and systemic inflammation, vasoconstriction and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation. Although the causality in the relationship between UA and CVD remains unproven, UA may be pathogenic and participate in the pathophysiology of CVD by serving as a bridging mechanism mediating (enabling) or potentiating the deleterious effects of cardiovascular risk factors on vascular tissue and myocardium.",2018,cardiovascular

Intensive research has elucidated the role of diet in cardiovascular disease and has led to public health policies focusing on educating the population on the role of nutrition in cardiovascular health. Compelling evidence shows that a healthy diet, rich in fruit and vegetables with moderate consumption of fish and a low consumption of animal by-products and processed foods, decreases low-grade inflammation and oxidation, leukocyte activation, platelet aggregation and microparticle shedding. Thus, following such a diet decreases the incidence of cardiovascular disease, lowers mortality and delays the progression of atherothrombosis.

Recently, due to lifestyle changes such as westernization of diet and lack of exercise, the incidence of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome has been increasing. They significantly affect atherothrombotic cerebral and lacunar infarctions. However, a few patients with lifestyle-related diseases remain untreated.

30191075,Exercise for stroke prevention.,"We review evidence concerning exercise for stroke prevention. Plausible biological reasons suggest that exercise would be important in preventing stroke. While definitive randomised controlled trials evaluating the impact of physical activity (PA) and exercise on preventing stroke and mortality are lacking, observational studies, small randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses have provided evidence that PA and exercise favourably modify stroke risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, excessive alcohol consumption and tobacco use. It is, therefore, important to understand the factors associated with poststroke PA/exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness. Positively associated factors include self-efficacy, social support and quality of patients' relationships with health professionals. Negatively associated factors include logistical barriers, medical comorbidities, stroke-related deficits, negative exercise beliefs, fear of falling, poststroke fatigue, arthropathy/pain and depression. Definitive research is needed to specify efficacious behavioural approaches to increase poststroke exercise. Effective techniques probably include physician endorsement of exercise programmesto patients, enhancement of patient-professional relationships, providing patients an exercise rationale, motivational interviewing, collaborative goal-setting with patients, addressing logistical concerns, social support in programsmes, structured exercise programming, individualised behavioural instruction, behavioural diary recording, reviewing behavioural consequences of exercise efforts, reinforcing successful exercise performance. Exercise programming without counselling may increase short-term activity; simple advice or information-giving is probably ineffective. Older patients or those with cognitive impairment may need increased structure, with emphasis on behaviour per se, versus self-regulation skills.

To examine sex differences in the dose-response association of VILPA with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and its subtypes. Using multivariable-adjusted cubic splines, we examined the associations of daily VILPA duration with overall MACE and its subtypes (incident myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke) among non-exercisers (individuals self-reporting no leisure-time exercise and no more than one recreational walk per week) in the UK Biobank. We also undertook analogous analyses for vigorous physical activity among exercisers (individuals self-reporting participation in leisure-time exercise and/or recreational walking more than once a week). Among 13 018 women and 9350 men, there were 331 and 488 all MACE, respectively, over a 7.9-year follow-up. In women, daily VILPA duration exhibited a near-linear dose-response association with all MACE, myocardial infarction and heart failure. In men, dose-reponse curves were less clear with less evidence of statistical signifigance. Compared with women with no VILPA, women's median daily VILPA duration of 3.4 min was associated with hazard ratios (HRs; 95% confidence intervals) of 0.55 (0.41 to 0.75) for all MACE and 0.33 (0.18 to 0.59) for heart failure. Women's minimum doses of 1.2-1.6 min of VILPA per day were associated with HRs of 0.70 (0.58 to 0.86) for all MACE, 0.67 (0.50 to 0.91) for myocardial infarction, and 0.60 (0.45 to 0.81) for heart failure. The equivalent analyses in UK Biobank's accelerometry sub-study exercisers suggested no appreciable sex differences in dose-response. Among non-exercising women, small amounts of VILPA were associated with a substantially lower risk of all MACE, myocardial infarction and heart failure.

The number of patients suffering from stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, pulmonary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, lower extremity artery disease and hypertension are 13.00 million, 11.39 million, 8.90 million, 5.00 million, 4.87 million, 2.50 million, 2.00 million, 45.30 million, and 245.00 million, respectively. Given that China is challenged by the dual pressures of population aging and steady rise in the prevalence of metabolic risk factors, the burden caused by CVD will continue to increase, which has set new requirements for CVD prevention and treatment and the allocation of medical resources in China. It is important to reduce the prevalence through primary prevention, increase the allocation of medical resources for CVD emergency and critical care, and provide rehabilitation services and secondary prevention to reduce the risk of recurrence, re-hospitalization and disability in CVD survivors. The number of people suffering from hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes in China has reached hundreds of millions. Since blood pressure, blood lipids, and blood glucose levels rise mostly insidiously, vascular disease or even serious events such as myocardial infarction and stroke often already occured at the time of detection in this population. Hence, more strategies and tasks should be taken to prevent risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, and smoking, and more efforts should be made in the assessment of cardiovascular health status and the prevention, treatment, and research of early pathological changes.",2022,cardiovascular

However, there are some comorbidities to take into account such as obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular or metabolic diseases. Improving dietary habits and promoting physical exercise are the two ways of preventing this. But, less than 50% of people with haemophilia actually do something in this sense, even though to practice physical activity or sport is save if you under treatment.",2023,cardiovascular

Diets that increase plant-based food sources and healthy unsaturated fats consumption and limit foods that are processed and/or high in sodium, refined sugar, and saturated fat are recommended. Dietary modification can be supplemented with lifestyle-based therapies (eg, exercise, time-restricted eating) to maximize clinical benefit and achieve the ""cardiometabolic jackpot."" Physicians should take into account cultural preferences, affordability and accessibility of foods, and their patients' cultural values or expectations when recommending dietary interventions.",2022,cardiovascular

These compound risks result in a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and possibly increased cardiovascular (CV) disease. As the cardiometabolic risk of PCOS is shared amongst the different diagnostic systems, all women with PCOS should undergo metabolic surveillance though the precise approach differs between guidelines. Lifestyle interventions consisting of increased physical activity and caloric restriction have been shown to improve both metabolic and reproductive outcomes. Pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery may be considered in resistant metabolic disease. Issues requiring further research include the natural history of PCOS-associated metabolic disease, absolute CV risk and comparative efficacy of lifestyle interventions.",2016,cardiovascular
37667966,Association of Device-Measured Physical Activity With Cardiovascular Outcomes in Individuals With Hypertension.,"There is insufficient evidence to show that the guidelines' recommendations of physical activity (PA) are associated with long-term benefits in individuals with hypertension. This prospective cohort study included UK Biobank participants with hypertension. Time spent on vigorous-intensity PA (VPA), moderate-intensity PA (MPA), and light-intensity PA (LPA) measured by wrist-worn accelerometer were extracted. The primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (including cardiovascular death, stroke, and myocardial infarction) and all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, respectively. The relationships of PA with outcomes were analyzed using Cox regression models. This study included 49 060 eligible participants with a median follow-up of 7.0 years. MPA was inversely associated with risks of major adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Modest amounts of LPA or VPA were likely to be more beneficial than higher amounts of either in all-cause death or cardiovascular outcomes. Compared with the least active group, 150 to 300 min/wk of MPA or more was significantly associated with decreased risk of all-cause death (by 34%-54%) and major adverse cardiovascular events (by 23%-41%), but 75 to 150 min/wk of VPA or more was associated with few further benefits, even weakening the cardiovascular benefits. MPA had an inverse dose-response association with the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with hypertension. Modest amounts of LPA or VPA are also beneficial, but higher amounts may be not. MPA may be the optimal PA intensity for individuals with hypertension. Further researches are required to determine whether high levels of VPA should be recommended.",2023,cardiovascular

And it results from multiple risks factors consisting of invariable factors (e.g. age, gender, etc.) and variable factors (e.g. dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, etc.). Meanwhile, CHD could cause impact not only localized in the heart, but also on pulmonary function, whole-body skeletal muscle function, activity ability, psychological status, etc. Nowadays, CHD has been the leading cause of death in the world. However, many clinical researches showed that exercise training plays an important role in cardiac rehabilitation and can bring a lot of benefits for CHD patients.",2017,cardiovascular
28463859,"Adiponectin, lipids and atherosclerosis.","Adiponectin is an adipokine with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiatherogenic, pro-angiogenic, vasoprotective and insulin-sensitizing properties. Several factors may influence adiponectin levels, such as genetic polymorphisms, obesity / body fat distribution, diet and exercise as well as cardiovascular risk factors such as sleep deprivation and smoking as well as medications. Adiponectin has been proposed as a potential prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target in patients with cardiometabolic diseases. This narrative review discusses the associations of adiponectin with obesity-related metabolic disorders (metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hyperuricaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus). We also focus on the links between adiponectin and lipid disorders and with coronary heart disease and noncardiac vascular diseases (i.e. stroke, peripheral artery disease, carotid artery disease, atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, abdominal aortic aneurysms and chronic kidney disease). Further, the effects of lifestyle interventions and drug therapy on adiponectin levels are briefly reviewed. Based on available data, adiponectin represents a multifaceted biomarker that may beneficially affect atherosclerosis, inflammation and insulin resistance pathways. However, there are conflicting results with regard to the associations between adiponectin levels and the prevalence and outcomes of cardiometabolic diseases. Further research on the potential clinical implications of adiponectin in the diagnosis and treatment of such diseases is needed.",2017,cardiovascular
35710276,Cardiac Concerns in the Pediatric Athlete.,"Cardiovascular disease remains the number one cause of death in Americans. It is no secret that exercise mitigates this risk. Exercise and regular physical activity are beneficial for physical health including aerobic conditioning, endurance, strength, mental health, and overall improved quality of life. Unfortunately, today many children and adolescents are sedentary, lacking the recommended daily amount of physical activity, leading to higher rates of obesity, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, anxiety, and depression. Given this rising concern, the World Health Organization launched a 12-year plan to improve physical activity in children and adolescents by reducing the inactivity rate by 15% in the world. How does this apply to children and adolescents with acquired or congenital heart disease?.",2022,cardiovascular
35227428,The Role of Physical Activity and Exercise in Preventive Cardiology.,"The cardiovascular epidemiologist, Jeremy Morris, called physical activity ""the best bargain in public health,"" but few clinicians use exercise and physical activity in their practice. Clinicians should routinely inquire about physical activity and recommend that patients achieve the minimal levels recommended by the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. Clinician should avoid unnecessary testing that discourages patients from an active lifestyle.

39990756,Strategies to Manage Obesity: Lifestyle.,"The treatment of obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is complex, and a variety of strategies are effective in the lifestyle interventions associated with these disease states. An interdisciplinary approach is the most effective treatment with the best results and outcomes. The lifestyle management of obesity includes interventions in nutrition, exercise, and behavioral health-all key components in managing most chronic illnesses. Effective nutrition interventions include the Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, and incorporation of more plant-based food options. Exercise is tailored to individual needs and emphasizes a gradual progression and incremental change with both aerobic and resistance training to manage weight and cardiovascular disease. Behavioral health focuses on practicing mindfulness, active self-awareness, sleep quality, stress management, and the use of therapy in overcoming barriers to success. These lifestyle factors are key in managing weight and cardiovascular disease.",2025,cardiovascular

In this article, a clinical case study is used to provide practical approaches for general practitioners and their teams to individualise exercise prescriptions for patients with hypertension who are at risk of CVD. The case presented describes a sedentary, overweight male with newly diagnosed hypertension - a common scenario in general practice. The many benefits of exercise are supported by an expanding body of research. Blood pressure can be safely and effectively reduced through physical activity, leading to a lower CVD risk. Value-based goal setting and the 'FITT' framework may be used to facilitate sustainable physical activity among patients. The engagement of allied health professionals such as exercise physiologists may also be beneficial.",2020,cardiovascular
29678447,Mediterranean Diet and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: What Do We Know?,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality is increasing, representing an important public health issue worldwide. It is well-known that risk of CVD is substantially influenced by lifestyle, including poor diet, tobacco smoking and physical inactivity. In the last years, the so-called Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) has been associated with broad healthy benefits on human health, including protection against CVD. The present narrative review aimed to summarize and discuss the evidence from meta-analyses of epidemiological and clinical trials analyzing MedDiet and CVD risk. The MedDiet is one of the best dietary patterns analyzed in relation to CVD risk and other health outcomes. Studies demonstrated that MedDiet has beneficial effects in the prevention of total and specific types of CVD, albeit a moderate-high degree of inconsistency has been reported and few studies have been included in most of the meta-analyses. As consequence, more high-quality prospective cohorts and randomized clinical trials are warranted in order to increase the confidence in the effect estimates.",2018,cardiovascular
38909663,Zoster Vaccine Lowers Stroke and Myocardial Infarction Risk in Chronic Disease.,"Herpes zoster increases stroke and myocardial infarction risk. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of live attenuated zoster vaccination on stroke and myocardial infarction risk in patients at risk of zoster, including those with hypertension, diabetes mellites, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, asthma, and chronic liver disease. This is a retrospective cohort study utilizing continuous de-identified claims data from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (collected from 2005-2018) containing data for 200 million commercially insured Americans. Participants included 27,093 adults vaccinated against zoster with at least 5 years of continuous enrollment, age and sex-matched 1:5 with unvaccinated controls. OR, risk difference, and the number needed to treat evaluated the effect of vaccination on stroke and myocardial infarction while controlling for relevant comorbidities. Over the period of 5 years, proportions of myocardial infarction (1.29% vs 1.82%; p<0.05) and stroke (1.61% vs 2.20%; p<0.05) were lower in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals, respectively, controlling for age and sex, with the greatest benefit for people with diabetes (stroke OR=0.64, 95% CI=0.58, 0.71; myocardial infarction OR=0.63, 95% CI=0.57, 0.71). Although hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had the highest odds of stroke and myocardial infarction, vaccination still provided significant risk-reduction (hypertension: stroke 0.75 [0.68, 0.83], myocardial infarction 0.73 [0.65, 0.81]; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: stroke 0.75 [0.68, 0.83], myocardial infarction 0.74 [0.66, 0.83]). Live attenuated zoster vaccination is associated with lower risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in adults with at-risk comorbidities, controlling for age and sex. Vaccination may provide cardiovascular benefits beyond zoster prevention.",2024,cardiovascular
28792455,Cardio-Metabolic Benefits of Plant-Based Diets.,"Cardio-metabolic disease, namely ischemic heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, represent substantial health and economic burdens. Almost one half of cardio-metabolic deaths in the U.S. might be prevented through proper nutrition. Plant-based (vegetarian and vegan) diets are an effective strategy for improving nutrient intake. At the same time, they are associated with decreased all-cause mortality and decreased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease. Evidence suggests that plant-based diets may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease events by an estimated 40% and the risk of cerebral vascular disease events by 29%. These diets also reduce the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes by about one half. Properly planned vegetarian diets are healthful, effective for weight and glycemic control, and provide metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, including reversing atherosclerosis and decreasing blood lipids and blood pressure. The use of plant-based diets as a means of prevention and treatment of cardio-metabolic disease should be promoted through dietary guidelines and recommendations.",2017,cardiovascular
39087351,"Leisure Sedentary Behavior, Physical Activities, and Cardiovascular Disease Among Individuals With Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease.","Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study assesses the association between leisure-time physical activity, sedentary behavior, and CVD risk among patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, considering genetic predisposition to CVD. This cohort study included 157 794 participants with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease from the UK Biobank who were free of CVD at baseline. The study measured leisure-time sedentary behaviors (watching TV, using a computer, and driving) and physical activities (walking for pleasure, light and heavy do-it-yourself activities, strenuous sports, and other exercises) in terms of frequency and duration over the 4 weeks before assessment. Both a Cox proportional hazard model and an isotemporal substitution model were utilized in the study to assess the association between leisure sedentary behavior, physical activities, and CVD risk. During a median 12.5 years of follow-up, 26 355 CVD cases were reported, including 19 746 coronary heart disease, 4836 stroke, and 7398 heart failure cases. High physical activity levels were linked to a significantly lower risk of CVD (21%), coronary heart disease (20%), stroke (15%), and heart failure (31%). In contrast, individuals with >6.5 h/d of sedentary behavior faced a 16% to 21% higher risk of these conditions compared with those with ≤3.5 h/d. Notably, replacing 30 minutes of inactivity with physical activity reduced CVD risks by 3% to 16%, particularly with strenuous sports. A significant interaction was observed between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and genetic predisposition in relation to stroke risk. Among patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, higher leisure-time physical activity levels correlate with reduced CVD risks, while increased sedentary behavior is linked to higher CVD risks. Replacing sedentary time with physical activity consistently shows benefits in reducing CVD outcomes, irrespective of genetic predisposition.",2024,cardiovascular
28353077,Role of Orexin-A in Hypertension and Obesity.,"Hypertension is one of the most challenging health problems inducing cerebrovascular disease and high percentage of death when associated with diabetes, dyslipidemias, and obesity. Orexin/hypocretin is a peptide expressed by a small number of neurons of the dorsolateral hypothalamus, a brain feeding and autonomic ""fight-or-flight"" regulatory center. According to this function, orexin has been demonstrated to evoke cardiovascular responses, heart rate, hypertension, hyperarousal, hyperphagia, and obesity. The focus of this review is to provide an overview about the mechanism through which orexin regulates food intake and cardiovascular responses and its role in the pathogenesis of obesity and hypertension which could be of great interest to establish possible new therapies. In normal rats and mice, central administration of orexin increases food intake, blood pressure, and sympathetic nerve activity and these effects are blocked by selective orexin receptor antagonist SB-334867 or almorexant. Moreover, upregulation of orexin signaling, in combination with elevation of epinephrine and norepinephrine circulating levels, occurs in rats exposed to chronic stress, in models of spontaneous hypertension (SHR and BPH/2J Schlager mice) and in obese mice (ob/ob or mice fed with high fat diet). Therefore, hyperactivity of orexinergic neurons could be a factor in the development of obesity and essential hypertension. Because of their widespread projections to the brain regions involved in appetite and cardiovascular responses, as far down as sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord, orexin evokes sympathetically mediated cardiovascular responses. Lasting upregulation of orexin signaling can lead to hyperphagia, obesity, and hypertensive state. Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) and selective orexin receptor antagonists (SORAs) have antihypertensive effects that could be of clinical use for regulation of food intake and hypertension, supporting the role of orexinergic neurons as critical checkpoint in the neurogenic control of metabolic and cardiovascular functions.",2017,cardiovascular
32622878,Childhood Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: Working Toward Solutions.,"The prevalence of obesity in childhood is high and continues to increase globally. It is currently estimated that 381 million children worldwide have overweight or obesity. This disease stems from multiple complex pathways that can present early in life. This is particularly concerning because childhood obesity is associated with cardiovascular risk factors that can lead to early atherosclerosis and premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertension, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and systemic inflammation are associated with vascular changes in childhood, and these contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular events in adulthood if not adequately treated. Interventions to treat childhood obesity include multicomponent family-based behaviour modification programs, which have been demonstrated to have moderate short-term effects on weight-related outcomes; their effects on cardiovascular risk factors, however, are less well understood. Although supervised, structured exercise interventions result in improvements in blood pressure, inflammation, carotid artery intima media thickness, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and endothelial dysfunction in children with obesity in the short term, our understanding of how to translate these interventions into long-term sustainable exercise or physical activity recommendations remains uncertain. Research focus in these areas will help in treating childhood obesity and associated CVD risk factors to prevent CVD development in adulthood.",2020,cardiovascular
32880740,The Role of Exercise in Patients with Obesity and Hypertension.,"This review sought to evaluate the role of exercise in patients with obesity and comorbid hypertension, with a focus on contemporary literature (since January 2015). No reviews have included patients classified with both obesity and hypertension and there is a paucity of randomised controlled trials examining the benefits of exercise in this population. Moreover, just one of 19 reviews examining the role of exercise on blood pressure included studies that met pre-defined inclusion criterion for hypertension, although seven conducted subgroup analyses stratified by mean baseline blood pressure. These demonstrated significantly larger reductions in blood pressure in hypertensive than pre-hypertensive and normotensive samples. There is a significant research-practice gap for understanding and influencing the role of exercise for patients with obesity and hypertension. This review provides recommendations for future research and consensus-based recommendations that promote exercise as a principle therapy for patients with obesity and hypertension.",2020,cardiovascular
39633563,Adherence to Physical Activity Recommendations Among Stroke Survivors in the United States.,"Physical activity is an effective modifiable behavior for preventing recurrent strokes. This study aims to determine the adherence to physical activity recommendations among stroke survivors in the United States. We further compared our findings with the adherence observed among myocardial infarction (MI) survivors and healthy adults, each assessed against distinct physical activity guidelines specific to their respective populations. We utilized data from the 2011 to 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a nationally representative survey. To establish benchmarks for stroke survivors, we referenced 3 different physical activity recommendations outlined in 2011, 2014, and 2021 American Heart Association stroke prevention guidelines. Similarly, for MI survivors and healthy adults, we used the 2011 guidelines for secondary prevention of coronary vascular diseases and the 2020 World Health Organization physical activity guidelines, respectively. Adherence to recommendations was determined by the respondents' self-reported intensity, duration, and frequency of physical activity. Multivariate logistic regression compared adherence in stroke survivors, MI survivors, and healthy adults. Among 48 222 stroke survivors in the United States, the overall adherence rates to 2011, 2014, and 2021 physical activity guidelines were 75.4%, 40.2%, and 69.2%. For independently mobile stroke survivors, the adherence rates increased to 78.1%, 42.1%, and 69.9%. Among MI survivors and healthy adults, the adherence rates were 42.7% and 72%. When 2021 recommendations were used as a benchmark, older (aged ≥65 years) stroke survivors were more likely to adhere to recommendations than younger survivors (71.9% versus 62.3%; <i>P</i><0.0001). After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities, non-Hispanic Black survivors were less likely to adhere to recommendations (adjusted odds ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.7-0.94]), whereas older and higher educated stroke survivors were more likely to adhere to recommendations. Geographically, stroke belt and nonrural residents were less likely to adhere to recommendations ([63.5% versus 67.9%; <i>P</i><0.0001]; [53.8% versus 58.7%; <i>P</i><0.0001]). Stroke and MI survivors were less likely to adhere to the latest recommendations than healthy adults (adjusted odds ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.69-0.8]; (adjusted odds ratio, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.22-0.26]). A substantial number of stroke survivors do not meet physical activity recommendations. Tailored interventions should be designed for at-risk populations, for example, non-Hispanic Black survivors and lower educated stroke survivors.",2025,cardiovascular
34927523,Early nutritional influences of cardiovascular health.,"Increasing evidence shows that nutritional choices during children's formative years, including prenatally, impacts the development of adult onset cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, or stroke. This literature review aims to synthesize the current body of evidence on nutritional factors, from conception through adolescence, which may influence a person's risk factors for future development of CVD. Given the escalating healthcare costs associated with CVD, it is imperative that medical professionals and scientists remain steadfast in prioritizing and promoting early CVD prevention, even within the first few years of life. Though not the only contributing risk factor, diet is a modifiable risk factor and has been shown to have a profound impact on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adult literature. Nutritional choices should be targeted on multiple levels: prenatally with the mother, individually with the patient, in conjunction with their family unit, and also within the broader community wherein they reside.

Further, presence of higher body fat, abdominal fat, liver and pancreatic fat and lower lean mass than whites, contribute to heightened metabolic and cardiovascular risk in Asian Indians. Importantly, conversion from pre-diabetes to diabetes occurs more rapidly, and reversion to normal glucose regulation with appropriate lifestyle measures is more difficult in Asian Indians than white population. Huge number of patients with diabetes and with complications increase morbidity, mortality and pose substantial economic burden. It is difficult, though not impossible, to decrease pace of rapidly expanding juggernaut of NCDs in India.

38453265,Mediterranean Diet for Cardiovascular Risk Reduction in Chronic Kidney Disease.,"The Mediterranean diet is a plant-based healthy diet similar to the vegetarian and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets. Unlike vegetarian and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets, the Mediterranean diet encourages a lifestyle associated with physical activity, and social connections. In addition, the Mediterranean diet is not based on restriction of nutrients but does limit intake of processed foods. Prospective studies have confirmed that the Mediterranean diet confers primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in the general population. The benefits of the Mediterranean diet lifestyle include reducing the risk of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and lowers blood pressure. In adults with CKD, adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower risk of CKD progression and its complications such as hyperphosphatemia and metabolic acidosis, and reduces production of uremic toxins and inflammatory mediators when compared to omnivore dietary patterns. Nevertheless, prospective studies are needed to confirm the cardiovascular disease prevention with the Mediterranean diet in adults with CKD. Medical nutrition therapy remains a cornerstone of CKD management, and the Mediterranean diet could be utilized to slow CKD progression and complications.",2023,cardiovascular

34473317,The Effects of Exercise on Lipid Biomarkers.,"The World Health Organization has declared obesity to be a global epidemic that increases cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis. The increasing ratio of time spent in sedentary activities to that spent performing physically demanding tasks increases the trends to obesity and susceptibility to these risk factors. Dyslipidemia is the foundation of atherosclerotic buildup and lipoproteins serve as cofactors to the inflammatory processes that destabilize plaques. Increasing cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength helps attenuate concentrations of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), such as LDL cholesterol, and increase levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as reduce proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 expression. Effects of physical activity on the inflammatory pathways of atherosclerosis, specifically C-reactive protein, are more closely related to reducing the levels of adiposity in tandem with increasing fitness, than with exercise training alone. The purpose of this review is to describe the physiology of dyslipidemia and relate it to CVD and exercise therapies.",2022,cardiovascular
35987633,Gene-diet interactions and cardiovascular diseases: a systematic review of observational and clinical trials.,"Both genetic background and diet are important determinants of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Understanding gene-diet interactions could help improve CVD prevention and prognosis. We aimed to summarise the evidence on gene-diet interactions and CVD outcomes systematically. We searched MEDLINE<sup>®</sup> via Ovid, Embase, PubMed<sup>®</sup>, and The Cochrane Library for relevant studies published until June 6th 2022. We considered for inclusion cross-sectional, case-control, prospective cohort, nested case-control, and case-cohort studies as well as randomised controlled trials that evaluated the interaction between genetic variants and/or genetic risk scores and food or diet intake on the risk of related outcomes, including myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and CVD as a composite outcome. The PROSPERO protocol registration code is CRD42019147031. We included 59 articles based on data from 29 studies; six articles involved multiple studies, and seven did not report details of their source population. The median sample size of the articles was 2562 participants. Of the 59 articles, 21 (35.6%) were qualified as high quality, while the rest were intermediate or poor. Eleven (18.6%) articles adjusted for multiple comparisons, four (7.0%) attempted to replicate the findings, 18 (30.5%) were based on Han-Chinese ethnicity, and 29 (49.2%) did not present Minor Allele Frequency. Fifty different dietary exposures and 52 different genetic factors were investigated, with alcohol intake and ADH1C variants being the most examined. Of 266 investigated diet-gene interaction tests, 50 (18.8%) were statistically significant, including CETP-TaqIB and ADH1C variants, which interacted with alcohol intake on CHD risk. However, interactions effects were significant only in some articles and did not agree on the direction of effects. Moreover, most of the studies that reported significant interactions lacked replication.

Evidence from large cohort studies and clinical trials underscores the impact of diabetes and obesity as major risk factors for CVD, causing systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and neurohormonal activation. Frequently, a sedentary lifestyle and unbalanced dietary habits are associated with these risk factors. Physical activity and exercise training interventions, a Mediterranean and plant-based diet, smoking cessation, and reduction of alcohol have shown promise in mitigating these risks. The implementation of lifestyle and pharmacotherapy have emerged as new pillars of preventive medicine.

36727942,Association of obesity and cardiovascular disease and progress in pharmacotherapy: what is next for obesity?,"Obesity has recently emerged as one of the most severe health concerns. Obesity is a key autonomous risk factor for heart failure and contributes to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic abnormalities. Obesity is caused by a metabolic imbalance, which occurs when calories burnt are fewer than the number of calories consumed. There are several pathways accountable for the adverse impacts of obesity on the cardiovascular system. Inflammatory cell infiltration develops in the adipose tissue, the pancreas, and other issues similar to the progression of obesity. Inflammation is triggered by immune cells that invade dysfunctional adipose tissue. The atherosclerotic inflammation phase, related to obesity, induces coronary calcification. Obesity is linked to elevated levels of leptin and high blood pressure. Leptin causes systemic vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and increased blood pressure by influencing the synthesis of nitric oxide and activating the sympathetic nervous system. Obesity is a well-known risk factor for CVD and is one of the leading causes of the greater risk of diseases, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, depression, metabolic syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure in adults and children. When used with dietary improvements, antiobesity drugs improve the probability of experiencing clinically healthy (5%) weight loss. This review aimed to address the consequences of obesity on cardiac structure and function, risk factors, the impact of the obesity paradox, pharmacological treatment strategies for managing and recommended exercise and diet.",2023,cardiovascular
26350421,Cardiovascular diseases and risk factors among Chinese immigrants.,"The aim of this study is to identify the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and major CVD risk factors, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity and smoking among Chinese immigrants by a systematic review of studies from various countries. PubMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched for studies of the prevalence of major CVDs and risk factors, and of CVD mortality among Chinese immigrants. The search identified 386 papers, 16 of which met the inclusion criteria for this review. In mainland China, there is a pattern of high stroke prevalence but low coronary heart disease (CHD) prevalence. Among Chinese immigrants, there is a much lower prevalence and mortality of stroke, but a higher prevalence and mortality of CHD, even though these are lower than the rates in immigrants of other ethnicities in the host country. The prevalence of CVD risk factors is also markedly different in immigrants. Compared with mainland Chinese, Chinese immigrants have a higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, higher serum cholesterol, poorer dietary patterns, and higher prevalence of obesity and smoking. Thus, the epidemiological pattern of CVD among Chinese immigrants changes compared with resident mainland Chinese. The less healthy environmental factor after immigration may be a major trigger in the adverse CVD status of Chinese immigrants. It is important for policy-makers to pay more attention to specific minority immigrant groups, and to implement more effective preventive measures to improve the health of immigrant populations.",2016,cardiovascular

Physical activity (PA), exercise training (ET) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are all associated with marked reductions in most CVD, including HF and CHD. Additionally, PA/ET and, especially CRF, markedly alter the relationship between adiposity and subsequent major CVD outcomes and dramatically impact the ""obesity paradox,"" which are all reviewed, including attention to the debate regarding ""fitness versus fatness"" for long-term prognosis, including in patients with established CVD.",2019,cardiovascular
37371490,Diagnostic and Prognostic Role of CD93 in Cardiovascular Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Cluster of Differentiation (CD) 93 (also known as complement protein 1 q subcomponent receptor C1qR1 or C1qRp) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that can also be present in a soluble (sCD93) form. Recent studies have investigated the role of this protein in cardiovascular disease (CVD). The present systematic review aims to assess the associations between CD93 and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and disease at both the proteomic and genomic levels. We conducted systematic searches in the PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases to identify all human studies since inception to February 2023 that investigated the role of CD93 in CV risk factors, CVD, and CV-associated outcomes. The data collection and analysis have been independently conducted by two reviewers. The search terms included: cardiovascular, heart failure, acute stroke, myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery disease, cardiovascular death, MACE, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, hyperuricemia, diabetes, cd93, c1qr, C1qR1, complement protein 1 q subcomponent receptor. A total of 182 references were identified, and 15 studies investigating the associations between CD93 protein levels or CD93 genetic polymorphisms and the development or prevalence of CV risk factors (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity) and CVD (i.e., heart failure, coronary artery disease, and ischemic stroke) were included. Although promising, the quality and dimension of the analyzed studies do not allow for a definitive answer to the question of whether CD93 may hold diagnostic and prognostic value in CVD.",2023,cardiovascular
38407170,Effects of physical activity on sleep quality and wellbeing.,"Physical activity (PA) has pluripotential beneficial effects on body functions. These benefits include reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and death. In addition to these effects, PA exerts significant beneficial effects on sleep onset, duration and quality, which add to its beneficial effects. In contrast, lack of sleep has been associated with increased incidence of CVD complications and death. In this regard, PA serves as a non-pharmacologic means for sleep improvement especially in older people, who frequently have difficulties in falling asleep. Regarding the timing of exercise and its effect on sleep, there has been no difference between morning and evening exercise on the onset and quality of sleep. With respect the beneficial cardiovascular effects of PA on sleep, there has been a debate among several investigators with some reporting significant beneficial effects of PA, and others reporting not significant beneficial effects. In order to get a better perspective on the effects of PA on quality of sleep, and its cardiovascular beneficial effects, a Medline search of the English literature was conducted between 2017 and 2023 using the terms exercise, sleep, cardiovascular disease, death and 36 pertinent papers were selected (Figure 1). The findings from these papers together with collateral literature will be discussed in this review.",2024,cardiovascular
30638928,Psoriasis and metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities in children: A systematic review.,"Psoriasis is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular and/or metabolic comorbidity in adults, but discordant data have been reported in children. To evaluate the frequency of metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidity in children with psoriasis and to establish whether age at onset of psoriasis correlates with metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidity in adulthood. We conducted a systematic review on MEDLINE, using PubMed and Ovid. The search was limited to children (<18 years). The following key words were used: ""psoriasis"" with ""children or childhood or adolescent"" and ""obesity"" or ""hypertension"" or ""diabetes"" or ""dyslipidemia"" or ""cardiovascular risk factor"" or ""myocardial infarction"" or ""stroke"" or ""coronaropathy"" or ""comorbidity"". The reference lists of the articles retrieved were checked for additional relevant studies. A total of 377 potential citations were analyzed. After removing duplicate articles and reviewing eligibility in titles and abstracts, 16 articles remained. The studies analyzed revealed significantly higher risk of overweight and obesity in children with psoriasis, despite the numerous definitions used. Four studies reported higher risk of abdominal obesity in children with psoriasis. Data on hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and major cardiovascular events suggested there was no higher risk of these comorbidities in children with psoriasis. Two studies suggested that age at onset of psoriasis did not increase the frequency of comorbidity in adulthood. This systematic review suggests that psoriasis in children is not associated with metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities, except overweight and obesity, for which higher prevalence is clearly demonstrated in the literature.",2019,cardiovascular
30563358,Prospects for the Primary Prevention of Myocardial Infarction and Stroke.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD), principally myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, is the leading clinical and public health problem in the United States and is rapidly becoming so worldwide. Their primary prevention is promising, in theory, but difficult to achieve in practice. The principal modalities that have demonstrated efficacy include therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLCs) and adjunctive drug therapies under the guidance of the health-care provider and tailored to the individual patient. The prevention and treatment of the pandemic of overweight and obesity and lack of regular physical activity, both of which are alarmingly common in the United States, prevention and treatment of hypertension, avoidance and cessation of cigarette smoking, adoption and maintenance of a healthy diet, and avoidance of heavy alcohol consumption all have proven benefits in decreasing the risks of a first MI and stroke as well as other clinical manifestations of CVD. Although adoption of TLCs would avoid the need for adjunctive drug therapies in many primary prevention subjects, this strategy is difficult to achieve or maintain for most and may be insufficient for many, especially those at high risk with metabolic syndrome. The criteria for metabolic syndrome, affecting over 40% of the adult population older than 40 in the United States, include overweight or obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance, a precursor of diabetes. The adjunctive therapies of proven benefit in the primary prevention of MI and stroke include statins, blood pressure medications, aspirin, and drugs to treat insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Fortunately, even for patients who prefer prescription of pills to proscription of harmful lifestyles, these drug therapies still have net benefits. The adoption and maintenance of TLCs and adjunctive drug therapies into clinical practice will reduce both the incidence of and mortality from a first MI and stroke as well as other major clinical manifestations of CVD.",2019,cardiovascular
34706491,How can exercise reduce cardiovascular disease risk? A primer for the clinician.,"Despite advances in drug development and medical treatments, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality across the globe. Fortunately, CVD can be delayed by engaging in appropriate lifestyle behaviors. An abundance of epidemiological evidence supports a direct association between increased levels of physical activity or cardiovascular fitness and reduced premature CVD morbidity and mortality. These data have been used as the basis for many medical organizations to issue physical activity guidelines to citizens to improve physical activity participation and, ultimately, reduce the risk of CVDs and other chronic diseases. Despite these efforts, physical activity participation around the globe remains low. The medical professional is well suited to promote exercise as a preventative treatment for CVD, although promotion efforts may be less effective without a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which exercise confers cardioprotection. Thus, the purpose of this review is to highlight the cardioprotective effects of exercise training and to explore the underlying mechanistic pathways that might explain these benefits. The review will focus on those physiological pathways that are directly involved in atherosclerotic disease development. They include hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.",2021,cardiovascular
34441038,Cardiovascular Disease Complicating COVID-19 in the Elderly.,"SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA coronavirus, causes an illness known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The highly transmissible virus gains entry into human cells primarily by the binding of its spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is expressed not only in lung tissue but also in cardiac myocytes and the vascular endothelium. Cardiovascular complications are frequent in patients with COVID-19 and may be a result of viral-associated systemic and cardiac inflammation or may arise from a virus-induced hypercoagulable state. This prothrombotic state is marked by endothelial dysfunction and platelet activation in both macrovasculature and microvasculature. In patients with subclinical atherosclerosis, COVID-19 may incite atherosclerotic plaque disruption and coronary thrombosis. Hypertension and obesity are common comorbidities in COVID-19 patients that may significantly raise the risk of mortality. Sedentary behaviors, poor diet, and increased use of tobacco and alcohol, associated with prolonged stay-at-home restrictions, may promote thrombosis, while depressed mood due to social isolation can exacerbate poor self-care. Telehealth interventions via smartphone applications and other technologies that document nutrition and offer exercise programs and social connections can be used to mitigate some of the potential damage to heart health.",2021,cardiovascular

It is known that about 80% of all mortality from cardiovascular disorders could be prevented if a healthy diet and higher levels of physical activity were included among general population's lifestyle. Besides, guidelines for the treatment and control of HTN were recently modified for adequate nutritional and physical activity recommendations highlighted in meta-analysis and strong evidences such as randomized clinical trials.

27297002,Cardiac Rehabilitation in Older Adults.,"The biology of aging and the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD) overlap, with the effect that CVD is endemic in the growing population of older adults. Moreover, CVD in older adults is usually complicated by age-related complexities, including multimorbidity, polypharmacy, frailty, and other intricacies that add to the risks of ambiguous symptoms, deconditioning, iatrogenesis, falls, disability, and other challenges. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a comprehensive lifestyle program that can have particular benefit for older patients with cardiovascular conditions. Although CR was originally designed primarily as an exercise training program for younger adults after a myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass surgery, it has evolved as a comprehensive lifestyle program (promoting physical activity as well as education, diet, risk reduction, and adherence) for a broader range of CVD (coronary heart disease, heart failure, and valvular heart disease). It provides a valuable opportunity to address and moderate many of the challenges pertinent for the large and growing population of older adults with CVD. Cardiac rehabilitation promotes physical function (cardiorespiratory fitness as well as strength and balance) that helps overcome disease and deconditioning as well as related vulnerabilities such as disability, frailty, and falls. Similarly, CR facilitates education, monitoring, and guidance to reduce iatrogenesis and promote adherence. Furthermore, CR fosters cognition, socialization, and independence in older patients. Yet despite all its conceptual benefits, CR is significantly underused in older populations. This review discusses benefits and the paradoxical underuse of CR, as well as evolving models of care that may achieve greater application and efficacy.",2016,cardiovascular
26826295,Obesity and Prevalence of Cardiovascular Diseases and Prognosis-The Obesity Paradox Updated.,"The prevalence and severity of obesity have increased in the United States and most of the Westernized World over recent decades, reaching worldwide epidemics. Since obesity worsens most of the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, not surprisingly, most CVDs, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, are all increased in the setting of obesity. However, many studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated an obesity paradox with regards to prognosis in CVD patients, with often the overweight and mildly obese having a better prognosis than do their leaner counterparts with the same CVD. The implication for fitness to markedly alter the relationship between adiposity and prognosis and the potential impact of weight loss, in light of the obesity paradox, are all reviewed.",2016,cardiovascular
27762312,Cardiovascular effects of bariatric surgery.,"Obesity is a major global health problem, and its multisystem effects are inextricably linked with elevated cardiovascular risk and adverse outcomes. The cardiovascular benefits of reversing obesity in adults are well-established. Compared with other weight-loss strategies, programmes that incorporate bariatric surgery for weight loss are beneficial for sustained BMI reduction. A marked improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, inflammation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, has been observed after bariatric surgery. This broad improvement in cardiovascular risk profile has led to substantial reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. As with all procedures, the benefits of bariatric surgery must be weighed against its potential risks. Modern bariatric surgery has an excellent safety profile, but important limitations remain, including the potential for surgical complications and nutritional deficiencies, and the lifelong requirement for nutritional supplementation. Surgery should be considered in patients with severe obesity, especially those with cardiovascular comorbidities. In this Review, we summarize the current management options for patients with obesity, and discuss the effects of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes.",2016,cardiovascular

A Systematic Review.,"More than 10.74 million people are currently held in penal institutions worldwide. Moreover, there is also evidence that the percentage of elder and female prisoners has been consistently growing. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Exercise training and physical activity help to prevent both primary and secondary cardiovascular events. Data on the influence of physical activity on the well-being in prison population is scarce. Here, we discussed, in a systematic review, the general health conditions and the cardiovascular risk profile in the prisoners compared to the general population and evaluated whether or not exercise could be a valuable tool in preventing these diseases in inmates. We performed a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement: 769 were initially identified, and a total of 24 studies were finally included. Nine studies evaluated the health conditions in prisoners, five studies evaluated the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) in the prison population, and 10 studies evaluated the feasibility and the effectiveness of exercise programs in prisoners. Sports-educational programs can benefit prison inmates. It appears that supervised exercise training is an effective coping strategy to deal with incarceration. Moreover, it seems the sports programs might be a useful tool in improving physical and mental health of prisoners as well as in decreasing cardiovascular risk factors.",2021,cardiovascular

26277725,Influence of Physical Activity on Hypertension and Cardiac Structure and Function.,"The global burden of hypertension is rising and accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality. Lifestyle factors such as diet and physical inactivity contribute to this burden, further highlighting the need for prevention efforts to curb this public health epidemic. Regular physical activity is associated with lower blood pressure, reduced cardiovascular risk, and cardiac remodeling. While exercise and hypertension can both be associated with the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), the cardiac remodeling from hypertension is pathologic with an associated increase in myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and risk of heart failure and mortality, whereas LVH in athletes is generally non-pathologic and lacks the fibrosis seen in hypertension. In hypertensive patients, physical activity has been associated with paradoxical regression or prevention of LVH, suggesting a mechanism by which exercise can benefit hypertensive patients. Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the benefits of physical activity in the hypertensive heart.",2015,cardiovascular

Interestingly, recent data suggest there is a gradient in the incidence, morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease across the spectrum of socioeconomic status, as this is defined by educational level, occupation or income. Additionally, dietary mediators seem to play significant role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, mediating some of the discrepancies in atherosclerosis among different socioeconomic layers.

36361072,Time-Dependent Effects of Physical Activity on Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adults: A Systematic Review.,"Physical activity is an important non-drug-related method to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases, but how exercise duration affects the cardiovascular metabolic risk factors in adults remains uncertain. This review systematically examines the time-dependent effects of physical activity on cardiovascular risk factors in adults and aims to further the understanding of the temporal therapeutics of exercise. Following the PRISMA guidelines, the PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and CNKI databases were systematically searched for relevant scientific studies from January 2000 to June 2022. A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. The sample size ranged from 11-275 participants who were diagnosed with obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM), and Coronary Heart Disease (CAD), while the subjects in four studies did not report any metabolic or cardiovascular disease. Four studies conducted trials of acute exercise interventions, while the remaining intervention periods ranged from 12 days to 12 weeks. The exercise interventions included aerobic training, resistance training, aerobic training that was combined with resistance training, compound exercise, and high-intensity interval exercise, and the training frequency varied from 2-5 times/week. Overall, this review found some evidence that the cardiovascular risk factors in adults may be time-dependent in response to physical activity. However, it is limited by the small sample size for each of the outcomes and several methodological issues, leading to poor comparability between studies. A randomized controlled trial with a larger sample size is supposed to be designed for the relevant population to completely test whether synchronizing the exercise time point in the day with the individual's circadian rhythm can amplify the benefits of the exercise for improving cardiovascular health.",2022,cardiovascular
39369878,Unique cardiometabolic factors in women that contribute to modified cardiovascular disease risk.,"Major risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) include hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome; all of which are considered inflammatory conditions. Women are disproportionately affected by inflammatory conditions, with sex differences emerging as early as adolescence. Hormonal fluctuations associated with reproductive events such as menarche, pregnancy and menopause, are hypothesized to promote a pro-inflammatory state in women. Moreover, women who have experienced inflammatory-type conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia, have a cardiometabolic phenotype that pre-disposes to increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and coronary heart disease. Women with no notable CVD risk factors are often relatively protected from CVD pre-menopause; but overtake men in risk of major cardiovascular events when the cardiovascular protective effects of oestrogen begin to wane. Sex differences and female-specific factors have long been considered challenging to study and this has led to an underrepresentation of females in clinical trials and lack of female-specific data from pre-clinical studies. However, there is now a clear prerogative to include females at all stages of research, despite inherent complexities and potential variability in data. This review explores recent advancements in our understanding of CVD in women. We summarise the underlying factors unique to women that can promote CVD risk factors, ultimately contributing to CVD burden and the emerging therapies aimed to combat this.",2024,cardiovascular
28432115,"Effects of Exercise on Vascular Function, Structure, and Health in Humans.","Physical activity has profound impacts on the vasculature in humans. Acute exercise induces immediate changes in artery function, whereas repeated episodic bouts of exercise induce chronic functional adaptation and, ultimately, structural arterial remodeling. The nature of these changes in function and structure are dependent on the characteristics of the training load and may be modulated by other factors such as exercise-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. The clinical implications of these physiological adaptations are profound. Exercise impacts on the development of atherosclerosis and on the incidence of primary and secondary cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Exercise also plays a role in the amelioration of other chronic diseases that possess a vascular etiology, including diabetes and dementia. The mechanisms responsible for these effects of exercise on the vasculature are both primary and secondary in nature, in that the benefits conferred by changes in cardiovascular risk factors such as lipid profiles and blood pressure occur in concert with direct effects of arterial shear stress and mechanotransduction. From an evolutionary perspective, exercise is an essential stimulus for the maintenance of vascular health: <i>exercise is vascular medicine</i>.",2018,cardiovascular
33062134,Impact of Lifestyles (Diet and Exercise) on Vascular Health: Oxidative Stress and Endothelial Function.,"Healthy lifestyle and diet are associated with significant reduction in risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Oxidative stress and the imbalance between prooxidants and antioxidants are linked to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Changes in antioxidant capacity of the body may lead to oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction. Diet is an important source of antioxidants, while exercise offers many health benefits as well. Recent findings have evidenced that diet and physical factors are correlated to oxidative stress. Diet and physical factors have debatable roles in modulating oxidative stress and effects on the endothelium. Since endothelium and oxidative stress play critical roles in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, dietary and physical factors could have significant implications on prevention of the diseases. This review is aimed at summarizing the current knowledge on the impact of diet manipulation and physical factors on endothelium and oxidative stress, focusing on cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. We discuss the friend-and-foe role of dietary modification (including different diet styles, calorie restriction, and nutrient supplementation) on endothelium and oxidative stress, as well as the potential benefits and concerns of physical activity and exercise on endothelium and oxidative stress. A fine balance between oxidative stress and antioxidants is important for normal functions in the cells and interfering with this balance may lead to unfavorable effects.

To investigate the role of MVD and CVHMs in the development of CHD among T2DM. We included 19 664 participants with T2DM from the UK Biobank who had CVHM data and were free of CHD during recruitment. CVHMs were defined based on 5 behavioral (body mass index, diet, sleep duration, smoking, and regular exercise) and 3 biological (glycemic control, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension) factors. MVD was defined as the presence of retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, or chronic kidney disease. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI of CHD were estimated by multivariable Cox regression models. There were 3252 incident cases of CHD recorded after a median follow-up of 12.3 years. After multivariable adjustment, each MVD was separately associated with risk of CHD, and those who had 1 or ≥ 2 MVD had a 27% and an 87% increased risk of developing CHD, respectively. Each unfavorable CVHM was associated with a higher risk of CHD. As compared with MVD-free participants who had ideal CVHMs, those who had ≥ 2 MVD and had poor CVHMs were at particularly high risk of incident CHD (HR = 4.58; 95% CI: 3.58, 5.86), similarly when considering behavioral CVH or biological CVH separately. On an additive scale, there was a positive statistically significant interaction between number of MVD and CVHMs. Coexistence of multiple MVDs was associated with a substantially higher risk of CHD among individuals with T2DM. Such association may be amplified by unfavorable CVHMs.",2024,cardiovascular

However, although vitamin D has been identified as a potentially important marker of CVD, the mechanisms through which vitamin D deficiency leads from endothelial dysfunction to myocardial infarction and stroke are not fully understood. Thus, the goal of this review is to provide an updated review of the literature on the basic science of how vitamin D may affect the cardiovascular system and in particular to analyze the role that vitamin D may have in the whole dynamic process from the initiation of endothelial dysfunction to the development of myocardial infarction and stroke.",2017,cardiovascular

Moreover, the ability to decrease the incidence of CHD has reached a limit utilizing traditional diagnostic evaluations and prevention and treatment strategies for the top five cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking). It is well known that about 80% of CHD can be prevented with optimal nutrition, coupled with exercise, weight management, mild alcohol intake, and smoking cessation. Among all of these factors, optimal nutrition provides the basic foundation for prevention and treatment of CHD. Numerous prospective nutrition clinical trials have shown dramatic reductions in the incidence of CHD.

27641779,Contemporary issues regarding nutrition in cardiovascular rehabilitation.,"In this article, we discuss certain contemporary and controversial topics in cardiovascular (CV) nutrition including recent data regarding the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, the role of saturated fatty acids, red meat and the microbiome in CV disease and the current role of personalized CV nutrition. Findings from the PREDIMED study now demonstrate the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet even in the absence of heart disease. The study highlighted that even small, sustained and easily implementable changes to diet can provide significant health benefits even in Mediterranean regions. Likewise, observational data in secondary prevention show that increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with good long-term clinical outcomes among subjects with stable coronary heart disease. The role of saturated fats in the development of CV disease remains controversial, although data suggest that these fats are associated with modestly increased risk of CV events. In contrast, the obesity epidemic currently driving the CV risk worldwide is in large part due to excess consumption of refined carbohydrates. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence suggests that the intestinal microbiome is highly sensitive to lifestyle choices and may play a pivotal role in modulating CV disease development. For example, recent evidence linking processed and unprocessed meats to increased CV risk pointed to the gut microbial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide as a potential culprit. Finally, given the high interindividual variability in response to interventions including diet, personalized nutrition has potential to play a major role in tailoring diets based on genetic make-up to maximize health benefits. This approach is still in its infancy but is highly promising.",2017,cardiovascular

34724167,Exercise Training: The Holistic Approach in Cardiovascular Prevention.,"Nowadays, there are robust clinical and pathophysiological evidence supporting the beneficial effects of physical activity on cardiovascular (CV) system. Thus, the physical activity is considered a key strategy for CV prevention. In fact, exercise training exerts favourable effects on all risk factors for CV diseases (i.e. essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, metabolic syndrome, etc…). In addition, all training modalities such as the aerobic (continuous walking, jogging, cycling, etc.) or resistance exercise (weights), as well as the leisure-time physical activity (recreational walking, gardening, etc) prevent the development of the major CV risk factors, or delay the progression of target organ damage improving cardio-metabolic risk. Exercise training is also the core component of all cardiac rehabilitation programs that have demonstrated to improve the quality of life and to reduce morbidity in patients with CV diseases, mostly in patients with coronary artery diseases. Finally, it is still debated whether or not exercise training can influence the occurrence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. In this regard, there is some evidence that exercise training is protective predominantly for atrial arrhythmias, reducing the incidence of atrial fibrillation.

Moderate to vigorous physical activity was considered as a time-varying variable. Physical activity trajectories were categorised as: stable-low, high-decreasing, low-increasing and stable-high. Exposure was also assessed at 70, 75, 80 and 85 years. Overall, physical activity was associated with lower rates of incident cardiovascular diseases. A significant risk reduction was present among men and was stronger earlier in late life (70-75 years). Trajectories of stable-high physical activity were associated with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes among men (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.86) compared with those with stable-low trajectories (p for trend 0.002). No significant association was found with stroke. The greatest cardiovascular risk reduction was observed for >20 min/day of physical activity, and was more marked at 70 years. Increasingly active trajectories of physical activity were associated with lower rates of cardiovascular diseases and overall mortality. Promoting at least 20 min/day of physical activity early in late life seems to provide the greatest cardiovascular benefits.",2022,cardiovascular
30047332,"Endothelial Regenerative Capacity and Aging: Influence of Diet, Exercise and Obesity.","The endothelium plays an important role in cardiovascular regulation, from blood flow to platelet aggregation, immune cell infiltration and demargination. A dysfunctional endothelium leads to the onset and progression of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). The aging endothelium displays significant alterations in function, such as reduced vasomotor functions and reduced angiogenic capabilities. This could be partly due to elevated levels of oxidative stress and reduced endothelial cell turnover. Circulating angiogenic cells, such as Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) play a significant role in maintaining endothelial health and function, by supporting endothelial cell proliferation, or via incorporation into the vasculature and differentiation into mature endothelial cells. However, these cells are reduced in number and function with age, which may contribute to the elevated CVD risk in this population. However, lifestyle factors, such as exercise, physical activity obesity, and dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, nitrates, and antioxidants, significantly affect the number and function of these circulating angiogenic cells. This review will discuss the effects of advancing age on endothelial health and vascular regenerative capacity, as well as the influence of diet, exercise, and obesity on these cells, the mechanistic links and the subsequent impact on cardiovascular health.",2018,cardiovascular
29895589,Physical Activity and Incident Cardiovascular Disease in Women: Is the Relation Modified by Level of Global Cardiovascular Risk?,"The inverse association between physical activity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is well- established and has previously been shown in people with and without single CVD risk factors. We examined whether level of global cardiovascular risk, on the basis of the pooled cohort equation or Reynolds risk score, which include multiple risk factors, modified the physical activity-CVD association. Participants in the prospective WHS (Women's Health Study; n=27 536) reported their leisure-time physical activity at study entry (1992-1995) and during follow-up through 2013. Participants were divided into 10-year cardiovascular risk groups on the basis of the pooled cohort equation and Reynolds risk score. The primary outcome was incident total CVD. The CVD hazard ratio for active (≥500 kcal/wk of physical activity) compared with inactive (<500 kcal/wk) individuals was 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.80) in multivariable models. This association was not modified by level of cardiovascular risk; physical activity was inversely associated with CVD within all pooled cohort equation and Reynolds risk score groups (<i>P</i>=0.17 and <i>P</i>=0.66 for interaction, respectively). When the joint association of physical activity and level of cardiovascular risk was examined, women with higher risk on the basis of either the pooled cohort equation or Reynolds risk score had higher CVD rates compared with those at low risk, regardless of physical activity. However, among women at both high and low risk, being physically active was associated with lower risk of CVD events. In this large prospective cohort of women, level of global cardiovascular risk did not modify the inverse association between leisure-time physical activity and incident CVD. Thus, promoting physical activity is important in women at both low and high cardiovascular risk.",2018,cardiovascular

29237243,Exercise-related severe cardiac events.,"Physical activity has benefits on health. However, there is a small risk of effort-related adverse events. The aim of this study is to describe exercise-related severe cardiovascular events and to relate them with the type of sport performed. We performed a ten-year retrospective study in eight Spanish cardiac intensive care units. Adverse cardiac events were defined as acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest or syncope related to physical activity. From 117 patients included, 109 were male (93.2%), and mean age was 51.6 ± 12.3 years; 56 presented acute myocardial infarction without cardiac arrest (47.9%), 55 sudden cardiac death (47.0%) and six syncope (5.1%). The sports with higher number of events were cycling (33%-28.2%), marathon or similar running competitions (19%-16.2%), gymnastics (18%-15.3%) and soccer (17%-14.5%). Myocardial infarction was observed more frequently in cyclists compared to other sports (69.7% vs 39.3%, P = .001). The most common cause of sudden cardiac death was myocardial infarction in those >35 years (23%-63.9%) and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation in younger patients (5%-62.5%). Significant coronary artery disease was present in 85 (79.4%). Only one patient with cardiac arrest presented with a non-shockable rhythm (asystole). Eleven patients (9.4%) died during hospitalization; in all cases, they had presented cardiac arrest. All discharged patients were alive at the end of follow-up. Exercise-related severe cardiac events are mainly seen in men. Coronary heart disease is very frequent; about half present acute myocardial infarction and the other half cardiac arrest. In our cohort, prognosis was good in patients without cardiac arrest.",2018,cardiovascular
40832810,"Sleep duration and quality, physical activity and cardiometabolic multimorbidity: findings from the English Longitudinal study of Ageing.","<i>Objectives:</i> We aimed to assess the prospective associations of sleep duration and quality with the risk of cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) and the interplay with physical activity. <i>Design:</i> Sleep duration and quality and physical activity were self-reported using standardized questionnaires. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity was defined as the presence of at least two multiple long-term conditions (hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases) at follow-up. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for cardiometabolic risk factors including physical activity. <i>Results:</i> We included 3,428 participants [mean (SD) age 63 (9) years, 44.8% male] free of hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke at baseline. At 15 years follow-up, 206 participants developed CMM. There was an approximate U-shaped trend between sleep duration and CMM risk. Compared to sleep duration of 7-8 hrs/day, the multivariable OR (95% CI) for CMM was 1.39 (1.03-1.90) for sleep duration ≤6 hrs/day and 1.05 (0.55-2.00) for sleep duration ≥9 hrs/day. The odds of CMM appeared to decrease with each additional hour of sleep among participants with short sleep duration (≤6 hrs/day), although this association did not reach statistical significance (OR, 0.78, 95% CI: 0.59-1.02). Sleep quality or physical activity was not associated with CMM. <i>Conclusions:</i> Short sleep duration is associated with an increased CMM risk independent of physical activity. The observed trend suggests that increasing sleep duration among short sleepers may help mitigate CMM risk.",2025,cardiovascular
26014650,Stroke in Latin America: Burden of Disease and Opportunities for Prevention.,"The epidemiological transition in Latin America toward older urban dwelling adults has led to the rise in cardiovascular risk factors and an increase in morbidity and mortality rates related to both stroke and myocardial infarction. As a result, there is an immediate need for effective actions resulting in better detection and control of cardiovascular risk factors that will ultimately reduce cardiovascular disease burden. Data from case-control studies have identified the following risk factors associated with stroke: hypertension; smoking; abdominal obesity; diet; physical activity; diabetes; alcohol intake; psychosocial factors; cardiac causes; and dyslipidemia. In addition to its high mortality, patients who survive after a stroke present quite frequently with marked physical and functional disability.

In this chapter, we will review the regulatory effects of miRNAs in cardiac adaptations to exercise, and summarize their cardioprotective effects against myocardial infarction, ischemia/reperfusion injury, heart failure, diabetic cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension. Also, we will introduce circulating miRNAs in response to acute and chronic exercise. Therefore, miRNAs may serve as novel therapeutic targets and potential biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases.",2017,cardiovascular
34134886,At the heart of the matter: Cardiovascular health challenges among incarcerated women.,"Many factors appear to contribute to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) among incarcerated women. Imprisonment is associated with a bodyweight gain and an increased prevalence of overweight and obesity. Inadequate physical activity and unhealthy nutrition further contribute to this positive energy balance. Classical CVD risk factors are common, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and smoking. Moreover, imprisonment is associated with an increased incidence of mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, with coping mechanisms, including substance abuse, being frequently adopted. Specific attitudes in the correctional environment, including hunger strikes, bullying, abuse and solitary confinement, are effectors of cardiovascular and mental ill-health. Furthermore, the plethora of psychological stressors induces an accelerated aging process, paired with CVD risk. Communicable diseases, mainly human immunodeficiency virus, opportunistic infections and inadequate sunlight exposure increase cardiovascular dysregulation. Health care needs associated with the female sex are not always met, adding to the frustration and compromised well-being. All these factors act independently and cumulatively, increasing CVD risk among incarcerated women.",2021,cardiovascular

The increasing trends are expected to accelerate as SSA continues to experience economic progress, population growth, and the shift from communicable to noncommunicable diseases. These complex disorders are caused by multiple, potentially interacting, environmental, and genetic factors. While considerable progress has been made in the identification of the sociocultural, demographic, and lifestyle risk factors for cardiometabolic disorders, many genetic factors that underlie individual susceptibility to these diseases remain largely unknown. Although progress in genomic technologies has allowed for systematic characterization of genome-wide genetic diversity in health and disease in European and Asian ancestry populations, conduct of genetic studies in SSA has been underwhelming until recently.

Data on the effect of eggs consumption on the risk of CVDs are still unreliable. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between CVDs and the consumption of eggs. In this case-control study, the required data were extracted from the Prospective Epidemiologic Research Studies in Iran (PERSIAN) cohort in Sabzevar, Iran. A total of 4241 adults participated including 1535 patients with CVDs as the case group and 2706 healthy people as controls. Egg consumption was assessed using a valid food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). A significant association was observed between eggs consumption and stroke after adjustment for physical activity, body mass index (BMI), smoking, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), using alcohol, lipid profile, diabetes, and the intake of energy, lipid, protein, carbohydrate, and cholestrol (OR:1.007, 95% CI:1.001-1.013, P = 0.03).

26941396,Physical activity in the prevention of coronary heart disease: implications for the clinician.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide. Because regular physical activity (PA) independently decreases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) while also having a positive, dose-related impact on other cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, it has increasingly become a focus of CHD prevention. Current guidelines recommend 30 min of moderate-intensity PA 5 days a week, but exercise regimens remain underused. PA adherence can be fostered with a multilevel approach that involves active individual participation, physician counselling and health coaching, community involvement, and policy change, with incorporation of cardiac rehabilitation for patients requiring secondary prevention. Viewing exercise quantity as a vital sign, prescribing PA like a medication, and using technology, such as smartphone applications, encourage a global shift in focus from CVD treatment to prevention. Community-wide, home-based and internet-based prevention initiatives may also offer a developing pool of resources that can be tapped into to promote education and PA compliance.

35055099,Endothelial Dysfunction: An Intermediate Clinical Feature between Urolithiasis and Cardiovascular Diseases.,"An epidemiological relationship between urolithiasis and cardiovascular diseases has extensively been reported. Endothelial dysfunction is an early pathogenic event in cardiovascular diseases and has been associated with oxidative stress and low chronic inflammation in hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke or the vascular complications of diabetes and obesity. The aim of this study is to summarize the current knowledge about the pathogenic mechanisms of urolithiasis in relation to the development of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular morbidities. A non-systematic review has been performed mixing the terms ""urolithiasis"", ""kidney stone"" or ""nephrolithiasis"" with ""cardiovascular disease"", ""myocardial infarction"", ""stroke"", or ""endothelial dysfunction"". Patients with nephrolithiasis develop a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease with a relative risk estimated between 1.20 and 1.24 and also develop a higher vascular disease risk scores. Analyses of subgroups have rendered inconclusive results regarding gender or age. Endothelial dysfunction has also been strongly associated with urolithiasis in clinical studies, although no systemic serum markers of endothelial dysfunction, inflammation or oxidative stress could be clearly related. Analysis of urine composition of lithiasic patients also detected a higher expression of proteins related to cardiovascular disease. Experimental models of hyperoxaluria have also found elevation of serum endothelial dysfunction markers. Endothelial dysfunction has been strongly associated with urolithiasis and based on the experimental evidence, should be considered as an intermediate and changeable feature between urolithiasis and cardiovascular diseases. Oxidative stress, a key pathogenic factor in the development of endothelial dysfunction has been also pointed out as an important factor of lithogenesis. Special attention must be paid to cardiovascular morbidities associated with urolithiasis in order to take advantage of pleiotropic effects of statins, angiotensin receptor blockers and allopurinol.",2022,cardiovascular
29795242,Interventions to promote cardiometabolic health and slow cardiovascular ageing.,"Cardiovascular ageing and the atherosclerotic process begin very early in life, most likely in utero. They progress over decades of exposure to suboptimal or abnormal metabolic and hormonal risk factors, eventually culminating in very common, costly, and mostly preventable target-organ pathologies, including coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, aortic aneurysm, peripheral artery disease, and vascular dementia. In this Review, we discuss findings from preclinical and clinical studies showing that calorie restriction (CR), intermittent fasting, and adjusted diurnal rhythm of feeding, with adequate intake of specific macronutrients and micronutrients, are powerful interventions not only for the prevention of cardiovascular disease but also for slowing the accumulation of molecular damage leading to cardiometabolic dysfunction. Furthermore, we discuss the mechanisms through which a number of other nondietary interventions, such as regular physical activity, mindfulness-based stress-reduction exercises, and some CR-mimetic drugs that target pro-ageing pathways, can potentiate the beneficial effects of a healthy diet in promoting cardiometabolic health.",2018,cardiovascular

A nationwide cohort of Spanish adults (18-64 years) was studied using a cross-sectional design and prospective observational design. Lifestyle-related factors (physical activity, sleeping characteristics, alcohol drinking, and smoking) were registered, and participants were classified as having an 'unhealthy' or 'healthy' cardiometabolic status attending to the presence or absence, respectively, of ≥1 CVD risk factor. A number of 596 111 participants (44 ± 9 years, 67% male) were studied at baseline, with prospective analyses in a subcohort [n = 302 061; median follow-up, 2 years (range, 2 to 5)]. Compared to normal weight, overweight and obesity were associated with a higher prevalence [odds ratio, 1.67 (95% confidence interval, 1.61-1.67) and 2.70 (2.69-2.78), respectively] and incidence [1.62 (1.59-1.67) and 2.70 (2.63-2.78)] of an unhealthy cardiometabolic status. Meeting physical activity guidelines reduced the odds of an unhealthy cardiometabolic status at baseline [0.87 (0.85-0.88)] among individuals with overweight/obesity, as well as of transitioning from a healthy status to an unhealthy status during the follow-up [0.87 (0.84-0.94)].

38939566,"Exercise blood pressure, cardiorespiratory fitness, fatness and cardiovascular risk in children and adolescents.","Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality on a global scale. Individuals who possess risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure (BP) and obesity, face an elevated risk of experiencing organ-specific pathophysiological changes. This damage includes pathophysiological changes in the heart and peripheral vascular systems, such as ventricular hypertrophy, arterial stiffening, and vascular narrowing and stenosis. Consequently, these damages are associated with an increased risk of developing severe cardiovascular outcomes including stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and coronary heart disease. Among all the risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure emerges as the most prominent. However, conventional resting BP measurement methods such as auscultatory or oscillometric methods may fail to identify many individuals with asymptomatic high BP. Recently, exercise BP has emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying real (high) blood pressure levels and assessing underlying cardiovascular risk, in addition to resting BP measurements in adults. Furthermore, numerous established factors, such as low cardiorespiratory fitness and high body fatness, have been confirmed to contribute to exercise BP and the associated cardiovascular risk. Modifying these factors may help reduce high exercise BP and, consequently, alleviate the burden of cardiovascular disease. A significant body of evidence has demonstrated cardiovascular disease in later life have their origins in early life. Children and adolescents with these cardiovascular risk factors also possess a greater propensity to develop cardiovascular diseases later in life. Nevertheless, the majority of previous studies on the clinical utility of exercise BP have been conducted in middle-to-older aged populations, often with pre-existing clinical conditions. Therefore, there is a need to investigate further of the factors influencing exercise BP in adolescence and its association with cardiovascular risk in early life. Our previously published work showed that exercise BP is a potential useful method to detect adolescents with increased cardiovascular risk. Children and adolescents with cardiovascular risk factors are more likely to develop cardiovascular diseases later in life. However, previous studies on the clinical utility of exercise BP have largely focused on middle-to-older aged populations with pre-existing clinical conditions. Therefore, there is a need to investigate further the factors influencing exercise BP in adolescence and its association with future cardiovascular risk. Our previous studies, which focused on exercise BP measured at submaximal intensity, have shown that exercise BP is a potentially useful method for identifying adolescents at increased cardiovascular risk. Our previous findings suggest that improving cardio-respiratory fitness and reducing body fatness may help to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and improve overall cardiovascular health. These findings have important implications for the development of effective prevention and early detection strategies, which can contribute to improved public health outcomes.",2024,cardiovascular

A qualitative study including 35 patients (21 men) with minor stroke or TIA (median age; 69 years, range 47-90) in semi-structured focus group interviews. Audio recordings were transcribed to text verbatim and analyzed with qualitative content analysis. Six interviews of 60 min. revealed five categories; the patients had a positive attitude towards physical activity, and they preferred to exercise locally under supervision of health professionals. Physical activity with others was motivating and obligating, and if possible as a weekly habit. Some experienced physical- and mental sequelae, which kept them from exercising. This study provides valuable knowledge of what motivates and prevents patients with minor stroke or TIA to be physically active after hospital discharge, and what to consider when designing future exercise studies. Consequently, it is recommended that patients with minor stroke or TIA are offered supervised physical activity to prevent worsening of cardiovascular disease and recurrent cardiovascular event.Implications for rehabilitationParticipants were positive towards physical activity after minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).Physical activity with others was perceived as both motivating and obligating.Post-stroke fatigue, lack of energy, and overview should be considered when designing secondary prevention programs.Participants call for exercise opportunities arranged locally and as group exercise supervised by health professionals with knowledge of stroke.",2023,cardiovascular
40102720,"Exploring the causal effects of physical activity, diet, and nutrition on hypertension and hyperlipidemia: a multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis.","Hypertension and hyperlipidaemia are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lifestyle interventions, including modifications in diet, nutrition, and physical activity, are commonly recommended, but their causal effects on these conditions remain uncertain. This study aims to explore the causal effects of these factors on hypertension and hyperlipidaemia using multivariate Mendelian randomisation analysis, providing insights for effective cardiovascular prevention strategies. Genetic data related to physical activity, diet, and nutrition were obtained from public databases and analyzed using multivariate Mendelian randomisation. The analysis employed MR Egger, weighted median, and inverse variance weighting (IVW) methods, with tests for heterogeneity and multiplicity ensuring the reliability of the results. In the hypertension analysis, low-calorie diets showed a positive association in weighted median and IVW analyses, with weighted median analysis showing an association of 1.122 (95% CI: 1.014-1.243, P = 0.026) and IVW analysis showing an association of 1.095 (95% CI: 1.013-1.184, P = 0.023). However, MR Egger's analysis showed no significant association (association of 0.688, 95% CI: 0.411-1.155, P = 0.230). Calcium supplements and dietary fibre did not demonstrate significant associations across all methods. Physical activity also did not show significant causal links with hypertension. Regarding hyperlipidaemia, calcium supplements exhibited significant effects across all methods, though with notable variation, while dietary fibre and physical activity showed no significant impacts. The study suggests a positive association between low-calorie diets and hypertension, as indicated by significant results from weighted median and IVW analyses. Other dietary factors, physical activity, and calcium supplementation exhibited varied or non-significant effects on hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. These findings highlight the need for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms and support the development of effective public health interventions.",2025,cardiovascular
25722442,Lifestyle effects on hematopoiesis and atherosclerosis.,"Diet, exercise, stress, and sleep are receiving attention as environmental modifiers of chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, the culprit condition of myocardial infarction and stroke. Accumulating data indicate that psychosocial stress and a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet aggravate cardiovascular disease, whereas regular physical activity and healthy sleeping habits help prevent it. Here, we raise the possibility that inflammation-associated leukocyte production plays a causal role in lifestyle effects on atherosclerosis progression. Specifically, we explore whether and how potent real-life disease modifiers influence hematopoiesis' molecular and cellular machinery. Lifestyle, we hypothesize, may rearrange hematopoietic topography, diverting production from the bone marrow to the periphery, thus propagating a quantitative and qualitative drift of the macrophage supply chain. These changes may involve progenitor-extrinsic and intrinsic communication nodes that connect organ systems along neuroimmune and immunometabolic axes, ultimately leading to an altered number and phenotype of lesional macrophages. We propose that, in conjunction with improved public health policy, future therapeutics could aim to modulate the quantitative and qualitative output, as well as the location, of the hematopoietic tree to decrease the risk of atherosclerosis complications.",2015,cardiovascular

27468925,Obesity and Subtypes of Incident Cardiovascular Disease.,"Obesity is a risk factor for various subtypes of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF), and stroke. Nevertheless, there are limited comparisons of the associations of obesity with each of these CVD subtypes, particularly regarding the extent to which they are unexplained by traditional CVD mediators. We followed 13 730 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study who had a body mass index ≥18.5 and no CVD at baseline (visit 1, 1987-1989). We compared the association of higher body mass index with incident HF, CHD, and stroke before and after adjusting for traditional CVD mediators (including systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and lipid measures). Over a median follow-up of 23 years, there were 2235 HF events, 1653 CHD events, and 986 strokes. After adjustment for demographics, smoking, physical activity, and alcohol intake, higher body mass index had the strongest association with incident HF among CVD subtypes, with hazard ratios for severe obesity (body mass index ≥35 versus normal weight) of 3.74 (95% CI 3.24-4.31) for HF, 2.00 (95% CI 1.67-2.40) for CHD, and 1.75 (95% CI 1.40-2.20) for stroke (P<0.0001 for comparisons of HF versus CHD or stroke). Further adjustment for traditional mediators fully explained the association of higher body mass index with CHD and stroke but not with HF (hazard ratio 2.27, 95% CI 1.94-2.64). The link between obesity and HF was stronger than those for other CVD subtypes and was uniquely unexplained by traditional risk factors.

Additionally, semaglutide 2.4mg sc has shown a reduction in cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, and symptoms of heart failure, while tirzepatide has demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular mortality and heart failure symptoms in patients with obesity and heart failure. The availability of these new drugs with arGLP-1 action represents a paradigm shift in the treatment of obesity, as they achieve greater weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic comorbidities.",2025,cardiovascular
37240361,New Approaches in Heart Research: Prevention Instead of Cardiomyoplasty?,"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in industrialized nations. Due to the high number of patients and expensive treatments, according to the Federal Statistical Office (2017) in Germany, cardiovascular diseases account for around 15% of total health costs. Advanced coronary artery disease is mainly the result of chronic disorders such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. In the modern obesogenic environment, many people are at greater risk of being overweight or obese. The hemodynamic load on the heart is influenced by extreme obesity, which often leads to myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure. In addition, obesity leads to a chronic inflammatory state and negatively affects the wound-healing process. It has been known for many years that lifestyle interventions such as exercise, healthy nutrition, and smoking cessation drastically reduce cardiovascular risk and have a preventive effect against disorders in the healing process. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms, and there is significantly less high-quality evidence compared to pharmacological intervention studies. Due to the immense potential of prevention in heart research, the cardiologic societies are calling for research work to be intensified, from basic understanding to clinical application. The topicality and high relevance of this research area are also evident from the fact that in March 2018, a one-week conference on this topic with contributions from top international scientists took place as part of the renowned ""Keystone Symposia"" (""New Insights into the Biology of Exercise""). Consistent with the link between obesity, exercise, and cardiovascular disease, this review attempts to draw lessons from stem-cell transplantation and preventive exercise. The application of state-of-the-art techniques for transcriptome analysis has opened new avenues for tailoring targeted interventions to very individual risk factors.",2023,cardiovascular
30048707,20-HETE in the regulation of vascular and cardiac function.,"20-HETE, the ω-hydroxylation product of arachidonic acid catalyzed by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4A and 4F gene families, is a bioactive lipid mediator with potent effects on the vasculature including stimulation of smooth muscle cell contractility, migration and proliferation as well as activation of endothelial cell dysfunction and inflammation. Clinical studies have shown elevated levels of plasma and urinary 20-HETE in human diseases and conditions such as hypertension, obesity and metabolic syndrome, myocardial infarction, stroke, and chronic kidney diseases. Studies of polymorphic associations also suggest an important role for 20-HETE in hypertension, stroke and myocardial infarction. Animal models of increased 20-HETE production are hypertensive and are more susceptible to cardiovascular injury. The current review summarizes recent findings that focus on the role of 20-HETE in the regulation of vascular and cardiac function and its contribution to the pathology of vascular and cardiac diseases.",2018,cardiovascular
33831953,A Systematic Review of the Association Between Vegan Diets and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease.,"Plant-based diets are gaining attention globally due to their environmental benefits and perceived health-protective role. A vegan diet may have cardiovascular benefits; however, evidence remains conflicting and insufficiently assessed. We evaluated the utility of the vegan diet in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. We conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating the association between vegan diets and cardiovascular outcomes. We searched 5 databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and OpenGrey) through 31 October 2020. Four investigators independently screened the full texts for inclusion, assessed quality, and extracted data from published reports. Out of the 5729 identified records, 7 were included, comprising over 73,000 participants, of whom at least 7661 were vegans. Three studies, with at least 73,426 individuals (including at least 7380 vegans), examined risks of primary cardiovascular events (total CVD, coronary heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, total stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and ischemic stroke) in individuals who followed a vegan diet compared to those who did not. None of the studies reported a significantly increased or decreased risk of any cardiovascular outcome. One study suggested that vegans were at greater risk of ischemic stroke compared to individuals who consumed animal products (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.95-2.48). Yet in another study, vegans showed lower common carotid artery intima-media thickness (0.56 ± 0.1 mm vs. 0.74 ± 0.1 mm in controls; P < 0.001), and in 3 studies of recurrent CVD events, vegans had 0-52% lower rates. Furthermore, endothelial function did not differ between vegans and nonvegans. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach, evidence was deemed to be of low to very low strength/quality. Among the Western populations studied, evidence weakly demonstrates associations between vegan diets and risk of CVDs, with the direction of associations varying with the specific CVD outcome tested. However, more high-quality research on this topic is needed. This study was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42019146835.",2021,cardiovascular
28215975,Physical activity and cardiovascular prevention: Is healthy urban living a possible reality or utopia?,"Favoring correct lifestyles is the most important measure to contrast cardiovascular diseases and the epidemic of high cardiovascular risk conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Lifestyle is a broad expression that includes diet, physical exercise, and psychological and socio-economic factors, each of which must be taken into due consideration because of their intertwining influences, which may be a barrier to healthy changes at both the individual and population levels. While physical activity has probably received less attention in the last decades, it is likely the most important among the modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Improving the habitual physical activity level is an achievable goal, and even small improvements may have important favorable effects on health. Strategies at the population level have to be urgently taken, and involve not only public health, but also administrators and politicians, starting from a rethinking of our cities.",2017,cardiovascular
33690068,"Cardiovascular disease risk, awareness, and treatment in people with epilepsy.","To evaluate whether cardiovascular risk, risk awareness, and guideline concordant treatment differ in individuals with versus without epilepsy. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We included participants ≥18 years for 2013-2018. We classified participants as having epilepsy if reporting ≥1 medication treating seizures. We calculated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk using the revised pooled cohort equation. We compared unadjusted and adjusted risk for participants with versus without epilepsy. We then assessed hypertension and diabetes disease awareness and control, plus statin guideline-concordance. We assessed mediators for both ASCVD risk and cardiovascular disease awareness. Of 17,961 participants, 154 (0.9%) had epilepsy. Participants with epilepsy reported poorer diet (p = 0.03), fewer minutes of moderate-vigorous activity per day (p < 0.01), and increased frequency of cardiovascular conditions (e.g. coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke). There was no difference in control of individual examination and laboratory risk factors between groups (A1c, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol). However, epilepsy was associated with 52% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0-130%) increase in ASCVD risk, which became nonsignificant after adjusting for health behaviors. No single studied variable (income, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), diet, smoking) had a significant indirect effect. Participants with epilepsy reported increased hypertension awareness which was trivially but significantly mediated by having a routine place of healthcare (indirect effect: 1% absolute increase (95% CI: 0-1%), and they reported increased rates of hypertension treatment and guideline-concordant statin therapy. Participants with versus without epilepsy reported similar rates of blood pressure control and diabetes awareness, treatment, and control. Participants with epilepsy had increased ASCVD risk, despite similar or better awareness, treatment, and control of individual risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. Our results suggest that epilepsy is associated with numerous health behaviors leading to cardiovascular disease, though the causal pathway is complex as these variables (income, depression, diet, exercise, smoking) generally served as confounders rather than mediators.",2021,cardiovascular
37037375,Relationship between empirical dietary inflammatory potential and myocardial infarction.,"Inflammation plays an important role in developing myocardial infarction (MI). This study examined whether a proinflammatory diet is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction. This analysis included 7,134 participants (60.3 ± 13.6 years; 51.8% females) from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination (NHANES-III). The proinflammatory diet was assessed using the empirical dietary inflammatory potential (EDIP) score, calculated from the Food Frequency Questionnaire. MI was defined from electrocardiograms (ECGs) using the Minnesota ECG Classification. The cross-sectional association between levels of EDIP modeled as tertiles and per 1-standard deviation (1-SD) increase in separate models with the risk of MI using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Participants with MI (n=230 (3.2%)) had higher levels of EDIP scores compared to those without MI (0.148 ± 0.241 score units vs. 0.106 ± 0.256 score units, respectively; p=0.01). In multivariable-adjusted models, each 1-SD (0.256 score unit) increase in EDIP was associated with 20% increased odds of MI (OR (95% CI); 1.20 (1.05 to 1.38)). Odds of MI increased as the levels of EDIP tertiles increased, indicating a dose-response relationship (OR (95% CI); 1,41 (1.0 to 1.99) and 1.48 (1.05 to 2.09), respectively). These results were consistent among subgroups of the participants stratified by hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, but effect modification by smoking status was observed (interaction p-value=0.04). Dietary patterns with high proinflammatory properties are associated with an increased risk of MI. Advocating for low proinflammatory dietary patterns could be an approach for preventing coronary heart disease.",2023,cardiovascular
35989414,Epigenetics in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: influence of exercise and nutrition.,"Increasing evidence links changes in epigenetic systems, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA expression, to the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). These epigenetic modifications can change genetic function under influence of exogenous stimuli and can be transferred to next generations, providing a potential mechanism for inheritance of behavioural intervention effects. The benefits of exercise and nutritional interventions in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD are well established, but the mechanisms are not completely understood. In this review, we describe the acute and chronic epigenetic effects of physical activity and dietary changes. We propose exercise and nutrition as potential triggers of epigenetic signals, promoting the reshaping of transcriptional programmes with effects on CVD phenotypes. Finally, we highlight recent developments in epigenetic therapeutics with implications for primary and secondary CVD prevention.",2022,cardiovascular
35179819,Lifestyle modification and inflammation in people with axial spondyloarthropathy-A scoping review.,"People with axial spondyloarthritis (AS) have an inflammatory profile, increasing the risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidaemia. Consequently, AS is linked with co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). Physical inactivity, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity influence inflammation, but knowledge of the interaction between these with inflammation, disease activity, and CVD risk in AS is dominated by cross-sectional research. A review of the literature was conducted between July 2020 and December 2021. The focus of the scoping review is to summarise longitudinal and randomised control trials in humans to investigate how tracking or modifying lifestyle influences inflammation and disease burden in patients with AS. (1) Lifestyle modifications, especially increased physical activity (PA), exercise, and smoking cessation, are critical in managing AS. (2) Smoking is negatively associated with patient reported outcome measures with AS, plus pharmaceutical treatment adherence, but links with structural radiographic progression are inconclusive. (3) Paucity of data warrant structured studies measuring inflammatory cytokine responses to lifestyle modification in AS. Increased PA, exercise, and smoking cessation should be supported at every given opportunity to improve health outcomes in patients with AS. The link between smoking and radiographic progression needs further investigation. Studies investigating the longitudinal effect of body weight, alcohol, and psychosocial factors on disease activity and physical function in patients with AS are needed. Given the link between inflammation and AS, future studies should also incorporate markers of chronic inflammation beyond the standard C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurements.",2022,cardiovascular
36706273,Association of physical activity and trajectories of physical activity with cardiovascular disease.,"Prolonged sedentary life existence is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD), obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, heart failure (HF), and all-cause mortality. On the contrary, regular exercise is known from antiquity to be associated with beneficial cardiovascular (CV) effects and decreased mortality. The cardiovascular (CV) benefits of exercise have been confirmed by many studies, but the trajectories of the different modes of PA are not well recognized. In order to examine the different modalities of exercise and its long-term trajectories, a Medline search of the English literature was conducted between 2015 and 2022 and 60 pertinent papers were selected for review. Careful review of the selected papers showed that the beneficial CV effects of PA are mediated through several favorable modifications of molecular and clinical factors. Also, any type of physical activity in conjunction with lifestyle adjustments is associated with decreased incidence of CVD, CHD, obesity, T2DM, hypertension, HF, and all-cause mortality. In addition, the long-term trajectories regarding the duration and the level of exercise are associated with greater beneficial CV effects, with even the resumption of discontinued exercise can lead to beneficial CV effects.",2023,cardiovascular
30522633,Reprint of: Prevention and Control of Hypertension: JACC Health Promotion Series.,"Hypertension, the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, originates from combined genetic, environmental, and social determinants. Environmental factors include overweight/obesity, unhealthy diet, excessive dietary sodium, inadequate dietary potassium, insufficient physical activity, and consumption of alcohol. Prevention and control of hypertension can be achieved through targeted and/or population-based strategies. For control of hypertension, the targeted strategy involves interventions to increase awareness, treatment, and control in individuals. Corresponding population-based strategies involve interventions designed to achieve a small reduction in blood pressure (BP) in the entire population. Having a usual source of care, optimizing adherence, and minimizing therapeutic inertia are associated with higher rates of BP control. The Chronic Care Model, a collaborative partnership among the patient, provider, and health system, incorporates a multilevel approach for control of hypertension. Optimizing the prevention, recognition, and care of hypertension requires a paradigm shift to team-based care and the use of strategies known to control BP.",2018,cardiovascular
29098616,Hypertension and Exercise Training: Evidence from Clinical Studies.,"Hypertension is a worldwide prevalent disease, mostly manifested as its primary ethiology, characterized by a chronic, multifactorial, asymptomatic, and usually incurable state. It is estimated that more than one billion of the world population is hypertensive. Also, hypertension is the main cause of the two most frequent causes of death worldwide: myocardial infarction and stroke. Due to the necessity of the cardiovascular system to manage chronically increased levels of blood pressure, hypertension causes severe alterations in multiple organs, as the heart, vessels, kidneys, eyes and brain, thus increasing the risk of health complications. The heart is the main target organ and suffers several adaptations to compensate the increased blood pressure levels; nevertheless, long-term adaptations without proper control are extremely harmful to cardiovascular health. On the other hand, hypertension is a modifiable risk factor and its adequate control is highly dependent on lifestyle. Pharmacological treatment is of great success when adherence is high. Several classes of antihypertensive drugs are prescribed and can effectively maintain blood pressure within acceptable levels. However, non-pharmacological methods, as diet and exercise training, can not only optimize the treatment but also prevent or postpone hypertension development as well as its complications, acting as important complements to the ideal control of elevated blood pressure, and bringing together benefits beyond blood pressure decrease, as a general health status improvement and increased quality of life. There is consistent evidence that regular exercise training promotes several benefits when properly prescribed and practised, acting as ""medicine"" for dozens of chronic diseases. The effects of exercise training in blood pressure levels and in its mechanisms of control are of clinical relevance and efficacy. This chapter will describe the classical and recent results on the beneficial effects of different modalities of exercise training in the cardiovascular system of human primary hypertension, focusing on the mechanisms influenced by exercise training which help to decrease blood pressure and improve the cardiovascular system.",2017,cardiovascular
38804635,Association Between Lifestyle Behaviors and Obesity Among Stroke Survivors.,"The aim was to investigate factors influencing obesity among stroke survivors based on demographics and lifestyle behaviors. Stroke survivors are more likely to experience stroke recurrence within a few years. As obesity is a traditional risk factor for stroke, obesity should be managed in stroke survivors to prevent stroke recurrence. A cross-sectional secondary data analysis analyzed data from the 2017 United States Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. Demographics, frequency of vegetable and fruit intake, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and sleep were examined. Among 1032 stroke survivors, 57.8% were obese. Advanced age, female sex, veteran status, at least once-daily fruit intake, current smoking, and lack of physical activity were associated with obesity. Stroke survivors should be encouraged to pursue healthy behaviors to manage obesity. Appropriate transitional care, including diet education and tailored exercise, can be an effective strategy.",2024,cardiovascular
37907844,Metabolic disorders and risk of cardiovascular diseases: a two-sample mendelian randomization study.,"Metabolic disorders are increasing worldwide and are characterized by various risk factors such as abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose metabolism, and dyslipidemia. Observational studies suggested a bidirectional association between cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders and its components. However, the causal associations between them remained unclear. This study aims to investigate the causal relationship between metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. A two-sample MR analysis based on publicly available genome-wide association studies were used to infer the causality. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms with potential pleiotropy were excluded by MR-PRESSO. The effect estimates were constructed using the random-effects inverse-variance-weighted method as the primary estimate. Furthermore, MR-Egger and weighted median were also performed to detect heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Genetically predicted metabolic disorders increased the risk for coronary heart disease (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.55-2.03, p < 0.001), myocardial infarction (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.52-2.03, p < 0.001), heart failure (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.14-1.39, p < 0.001), hypertension (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02, p = 0.002), and stroke (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08-1.32, p < 0.001). The concordance of the results of various complementary sensitivity MR methods reinforces the causal relationship further. This study provides evidence of a causal relationship between metabolic disorders and increased risk of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, hypertension, and stroke. Special attention should be paid to improving metabolic disorders to reduce the development of cardiovascular diseases.",2023,cardiovascular
32600339,Cardiovascular and diabetes burden attributable to physical inactivity in Mexico.,"Physical inactivity (PI) is associated with the development of non-communicable chronic diseases. The purposes of this study were to estimate the extent to which the 31% relative increase in PI among 35-64 years old Mexicans between 2006 and 2012 influenced diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality, and to estimate the impact of the World Health Organization recommended 10% and 15% relative decrease in PI on CVD and T2D incidence and mortality by 2025 and 2030, respectively. Estimates were derived using the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model-Mexico, a computer simulation, Markov model. Model inputs included cross-national data on PI levels from 2006 and 2012 measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the published literature review on the independent relationship between PI and cardiometabolic risk. The models estimated that the 31% increase in PI resulted in an increase in the number of cases of T2D (27,100), coronary heart disease (10,300), stroke (2200), myocardial infarction (1500), stroke deaths (400) and coronary heart disease deaths (350). A hypothetical 10% lowering of PI by 2025 compared to status quo is projected to prevent 8400 cases of T2D, 4200 cases of CHD, 1000 cases of stroke, 700 cases of MI, and 200 deaths of CHD and stroke, respectively. A 15% reduction resulted in larger decreases. While the burden of T2D and CVD raised from 2006 to 2012 in association with increased PI, achieving the WHO targets by 2030 could help reverse these trends.",2020,cardiovascular
27112972,Cardiovascular risk in climacteric women: focus on diet.,"A literature search was made using PubMed. The proportion of postmenopausal women has been continually increasing because of enhanced life expectancy.

All over the world, obesity rates are increasing and this fact is associated with expanded rates of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Many of these well-known risk factors for CVD can be modified by lifestyle changes. For this reason, nutritional strategies to prevent CVD in this population should be a primary objective for health-care providers. Any attempt at lifestyle modification should include behavioral changes and the implementation of healthy diets and physical activity. The Mediterranean diet is comparable with other interventions such as aspirin, statins, physical activity, and even antihypertensives in terms of reducing the risk of CVD morbidity, mortality and events.

In this cohort, we aimed to investigate the associations between both total and leisure time physical activity in detail, and the risks of myocardial infarction and stroke, both overall and for men and women separately. We assessed the association between total and leisure time physical activity on the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in a cohort of 31,580 men and women through record linkages from 1997-2016. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on detailed self-reported physical activity. In the adjusted analyses, we included age, sex, body mass index, level of education, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, lipid disturbance and hypertension as potential confounders. We identified 1,621 incident cases of myocardial infarction and 1,879 of stroke. Among men, there was an inverse association between leisure time activity and myocardial infarction in the third tertile compared to the first (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.62-0.98; p for trend = 0.03). We also found an inverse association between leisure time activity and stroke in the third tertile compared to the first (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61-0.99; p for trend = 0.04), while the corresponding HR for stroke among women was 0.91; 95% CI: 0.74-1.13. We found no significant association between total physical activity and MI (HR: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.93-1.34) or stroke (HR: 1.14 95% CI: 0.94-1.39) comparing the highest to the lowest tertile in men. Women in the highest tertile of total physical activity had a 22% lower risk of myocardial infarction compared to the lowest tertile (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63-0.97; p for trend = 0.02) and an 8% (95% CI: 0.87-0.98) reduced risk of myocardial infarction with each 1 METh/day increase of leisure time physical activity.

31025109,Recommendations for exercise and screening for safe athletic participation in hypertensive youth.,"Physical activity is an important component of ideal cardiovascular health. Current guidelines recommend that youth with hypertension participate in competitive sports once hypertensive target organ effects and risks have been assessed and that children with hypertension receive treatment to lower BP below stage 2 thresholds (e.g., < 140/90 mmHg or < 95th percentile + 12 mmHg) before participating in competitive sports. Despite these recommendations, pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists continue to struggle with how best to counsel their patients regarding appropriate forms of physical activity, the impact of exercise on blood pressure, and how best to screen for cardiovascular conditions that place youth at risk for sudden cardiac death. This review provides a summary of our current knowledge regarding the safety and utility of exercise in the management of high blood pressure in youth. We review determinants of blood pressure during exercise, the impact of blood pressure on cardiovascular health and structure, mechanisms for assessing cardiometabolic fitness (e.g., exercise stress test), contraindications to athletic participation, and how best to plan for athletic participation among hypertensive youth. Greater knowledge in these areas may offer clarity to providers faced with the challenge of prescribing exercise recommendations for hypertensive youth.",2020,cardiovascular
29065479,"Psoriasis and Cardiovascular Comorbidities: Focusing on Severe Vascular Events, Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Implications for Treatment.","Psoriasis is a common and chronic inflammatory disease of the skin. It may impair the physical and psychosocial function of patients and lead to decreased quality of life. Traditionally, psoriasis has been regarded as a disease affecting only the skin and joints. More recently, studies have shown that psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disorder which can be associated with various comorbidities. In particular, psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of developing severe vascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. In addition, the prevalence rates of cardiovascular risk factors are increased, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Consequently, mortality rates have been found to be increased and life expectancy decreased in patients with psoriasis, as compared to the general population. Various studies have also shown that systemic treatments for psoriasis, including methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, may significantly decrease cardiovascular risk. Mechanistically, the presence of common inflammatory pathways, secretion of adipokines, insulin resistance, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, microparticles, and hypercoagulability may explain the association between psoriasis and cardiometabolic disorders. In this article, we review the evidence regarding the association between psoriasis and cardiovascular comorbidities, focusing on severe vascular events, cardiovascular risk factors and implications for treatment.",2017,cardiovascular
36258193,Association between exercise and risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.,"Although cardiovascular comorbidities negatively impact survival in patients with bronchiectasis, there is limited evidence to recommend exercise in this population. We aimed to evaluate whether exercise habit changes are related to reduced cardiovascular disease risk and explore an optimal exercise amount. This study identified 165,842 patients with newly diagnosed bronchiectasis during 2010-2016 who underwent two health examinations and were followed up until December 2020. The exposure was the change in weekly habits of moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity between the two examinations, classified into non-exercisers and exercisers (further classified into new exercisers, exercise dropouts, and exercise maintainers). The amount of exercise was measured using metabolic equivalents of task (MET). The outcome was the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. During a mean of 6.2 ± 2.1 follow-up years, 4,233 (2.6%) and 3,745 (2.3%) of patients with bronchiectasis had MI or stroke, respectively. Compared to non-exercisers, exercisers had a significantly lower risk of MI or stroke by 9-28% (p < 0.001 for both). Among exercisers, exercise maintainers showed the lowest risk of MI (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.81) and stroke (aHR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64-0.82) compared to non-exercisers. Regarding exercise amount, a significant risk reduction was observed only in patients with bronchiectasis who exercised for ≥ 500 MET-min/wk. Exercise was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients with bronchiectasis. In particular, the risk was lowest in exercise maintainers, and cardiovascular risk reduction was significant when exercising more than 500 MET-min/wk.",2022,cardiovascular
32124663,The evolution of the heart-healthy diet for vascular health: A walk through time.,"The rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality reduction in the United States has plateaued recently, despite the development of novel preventive pharmacotherapies, increased access to care, and healthcare spending. This is largely due to American's poor dietary patterns and practices causing increasing trends in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. For decades, dietary guidelines on 'healthy diets' to reduce CVD risk, grounded in epidemiological research, have been nationally distributed to Americans. In this review, we highlight landmark events in modern nutrition science and how these have framed past and current understandings of diet and health. We also follow the evolution of dietary recommendations for Americans throughout the years, with an emphasis on recommendations aimed to reduce risk for CVD and mortality. Secondly, we examine how the low-fat ideology came to dominate America in the last decades of the 20th century and subsequently contributed to an excess intake of refined carbohydrates which, in the context of an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, may have fueled the obesity epidemic. We then examine the current major evidence-based dietary patterns and specific dietary approaches to reduce CVD risk, reviewing the literature surrounding nutritional components of the heart-healthy diet and discussing the dietary patterns proven most effective for CVD prevention: the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, the Mediterranean diet, and the healthy vegetarian diet. Finally, we discuss emerging dietary trends, considerations for nutrition counseling, and future directions within the important field of nutrition, with the ultimate goal of improving vascular health.",2020,cardiovascular
37299463,An Overview of Diet and Physical Activity for Healthy Weight in Adolescents and Young Adults with Type 1 Diabetes: Lessons Learned from the ACT1ON Consortium.,"The prevalence of overweight and obesity in young people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) now parallels that of the general population. Excess adiposity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is already elevated up to 10-fold in T1D, underscoring a compelling need to address weight management as part of routine T1D care. Sustainable weight management requires both diet and physical activity (PA). Diet and PA approaches must be optimized towards the underlying metabolic and behavioral challenges unique to T1D to support glycemic control throughout the day. Diet strategies for people with T1D need to take into consideration glycemic management, metabolic status, clinical goals, personal preferences, and sociocultural considerations. A major barrier to weight management in this high-risk population is the challenge of integrating regular PA with day-to-day management of T1D. Specifically, exercise poses a substantial challenge due to the increased risk of hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemia. Indeed, about two-thirds of individuals with T1D do not engage in the recommended amount of PA. Hypoglycemia presents a serious health risk, yet prevention and treatment often necessitates the consumption of additional calories, which may prohibit weight loss over time. Exercising safely is a concern and challenge with weight management and maintaining cardiometabolic health for individuals living with T1D and many healthcare professionals. Thus, a tremendous opportunity exists to improve exercise participation and cardiometabolic outcomes in this population. This article will review dietary strategies, the role of combined PA and diet for weight management, current resources for PA and glucose management, barriers to PA adherence in adults with T1D, as well as findings and lessons learned from the Advancing Care for Type 1 Diabetes and Obesity Network (ACT1ON).",2023,cardiovascular

This article provides an overview of methods and practices aimed at helping women achieve a healthy weight between pregnancies by improving gestational weight gain. These interventions include lifestyle behavioral changes, diet and exercise, and motivational interviewing.",2020,cardiovascular
27121507,Neurotrophic and Neuroprotective Effects of Muscle Contraction.,"Physical activity has been shown to be associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease but the same effect seems to be produced in neurological diseases. In this review, we focused on the interplay between physical activity and some neurological conditions (Stroke, dementia, epilepsy, headache, Parkinson' s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, insomnia, depression and anxiety) with the aim of describing the potential role of physical activity in the prevention of such diseases and the physiological mechanisms involved in these processes. Despite a growing body of evidence which reveals that physical activity is able to reduce the frequency of neurological diseases, directly or indirectly by enhancing cardiovascular conditions, further studies are necessary to better characterize which type of exercise is useful for each condition. Physical activity could represent an additional approach to fight against such diseases.",2016,cardiovascular
34251088,Metabolically healthy obesity and cardiovascular events: A nationwide cohort study.,"To evaluate the associations between metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and different types of incident cardiovascular events in a contemporary population. All patients discharged from French hospitals in 2013 with at least 5 years of follow-up and without a history of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; myocardial infarction, heart failure [HF], ischaemic stroke or cardiovascular death [MACE-HF]) or underweight/malnutrition were identified. They were categorized by phenotypes defined by obesity and three metabolic abnormalities (diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia). Hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular events during follow-up were adjusted on age, sex and smoking status at baseline. In total, 2 873 039 individuals were included in the analysis, among whom 272 838 (9.5%) had obesity. During a mean follow-up of 4.9 years, when pooling men and women, individuals with MHO had a higher risk of MACE-HF (multivariate-adjusted HR 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-1.24), new-onset HF (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.31-1.37) and atrial fibrillation (AF; HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.30-1.37) compared with individuals with no obesity and zero metabolic abnormalities. By contrast, risks were not higher for myocardial infarction (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.98), ischaemic stroke (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.98) and cardiovascular death (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93-1.04). MHO in men was associated with a higher risk of clinical events compared with metabolically healthy men of normal weight (HR 1.12-1.80), while women with MHO had a lower risk for most events than metabolically healthy women of normal weight (HR 0.49-0.99). In a large and contemporary analysis of patients seen in French hospitals, individuals with MHO did not have a higher risk of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke or cardiovascular death than metabolically healthy individuals with no obesity. By contrast, they had a higher risk of new-onset HF and new-onset AF. However, notable differences were observed in men and women in the sex-stratified analysis.",2021,cardiovascular
38430149,Research Progress in the Relationship Between Trimethylamine Oxide and Coronary Heart Disease.,"To provide a theoretical basis for intestinal intervention in the treatment of coronary heart disease. Summarizing the mechanism of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) inducing coronary heart disease and discussing the target of clinical intervention including TMAO generation, metabolism, and other links. The authors also clarified the potential clinical value of TMAO as a predictor of cardiovascular disease．. The intestinal microbiota metabolite TMAO is closely related to the occurrence and development of coronary heart disease. TMAO can induce the development of coronary heart disease by promoting endothelial cell dysfunction, promoting foam cell formation, affecting cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, and promoting platelet activation and thrombosis. Diet, physical exercise, and other ways can reshape intestinal flora, inhibit TMAO generation, and help to prevent and cure coronary heart disease. In addition, TMAO has important clinical value in predicting risk stratification and evaluating the prognosis of coronary heart disease. TMAO can induce and assist in the development of coronary heart disease by promoting endothelial cell dysfunction, foam cell formation, and other mechanisms. At present, diet and physical exercise can reduce the production of TMAO to a certain extent, to prevent the occurrence and development of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, TMAO is a promising predictive marker for risk stratification and evaluating the prognosis of coronary heart disease.TMAO can not only directly induce coronary heart disease by promoting endothelial cell dysfunction, foam cell formation and other mechanisms, but also promote the occurrence and development of coronary heart disease by affecting the risk factors related to coronary heart disease (such as hypertension and diabetes). It has been confirmed that diet and physical exercise can reduce the production of TMAO to a certain extent and prevent the occurrence and development of coronary heart disease. In addition, TMAO is a valuable indicator for assessing risk stratification and prognosis of coronary heart disease.",2024,cardiovascular
37489789,An Evidence Base for Heart Disease Prevention using a Mediterranean Diet Comprised Primarily of Vegetarian Food.,"Dietary patterns, nutrition, physical activity, air pollution, tobacco smoke, ethnicity and genetics affect heart disease. Vegetarian food diets are one of the important factors in its prevention and control. People living in the five blue zones, mostly consuming the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), have the highest longevity in the world and the least incidence of heart disease. There are several forms of heart pathology, e.g., the most common coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, heart valve disease and abnormal heart rhythms. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world and varies by race, where indigenous and people of color have a higher risk for its complications than the white population. The morbidity of cardiovascular pathology in the Afro-American community persists high and is a primary source of disparities in life expectancy between Afro-Americans and whites in the United States. Adherence to healthy diets higher in vegetable foods and lower in animal foods is correlated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, morbidity and mortality in the general population. A detailed literature review was performed of the Medline, EMBASE, and Ebsco databases to synthesize and compare evidence on this topic to produce a review of the importance of a Mediterranean diet in the prevention of heart disease. Consumption of a MedDiet consisting of fruits and vegetables (including berries due to their high fibre and antioxidant content), nuts, whole grains, leafy greens, beans like chickpeas, eggplants, Greek yogurt and extra virgin olive oil are associated with longer life and lower incidence of heart disease. The latter diet is superior to consuming large quantities of meat and refined carbohydrates, such as sucrose, high fructose corn syrup and grains that have had the fibrous and nutritious parts removed.",2023,cardiovascular
32390492,Physical Activity and Incident Heart Failure in High-Risk Subgroups: The ARIC Study.,"Background Greater physical activity (PA) is associated with lower heart failure (HF) risk. However, it is unclear whether this inverse association exists across all subgroups at high risk for HF, particularly among those with preexisting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Methods and Results We followed 13 810 ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study participants (mean age 55 years, 54% women, 26% black) without HF at baseline (visit 1; 1987-1989). PA was assessed using a modified Baecke questionnaire and categorized according to American Heart Association guidelines: recommended, intermediate, or poor. We constructed Cox models to estimate associations between PA categories and incident HF within each high-risk subgroup at baseline, with tests for interaction. We performed additional analyses modeling incident coronary heart disease as a time-varying covariate. Over a median of 26 years of follow-up, there were 2994 HF events. Compared with poor PA, recommended PA was associated with lower HF risk among participants with hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome (all <i>P</i><0.01), but not among those with prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease) (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74-1.13 [<i>P</i> interaction=0.02]). Recommended PA was associated with lower risk of incident coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72-0.86), but not with lower HF risk in those with interim coronary heart disease events (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78-1.04 [<i>P</i> interaction=0.04]). Conclusions PA was associated with decreased HF risk in patients with hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome. Despite a myriad of benefits in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, PA may have weaker associations with HF prevention after ischemic disease is established.",2020,cardiovascular

The study aims to assess the modifiable risk factors and the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) associated with anthropometric, physiometabolic and lifestyle profiles in a sample of Spanish aviation pilots. Data from pilots' clinical and professional history, anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance assessments of nutritional status, and diet and physical activity questionnaires. The sample comprised 304 men pilots. Up to 53.6% showed excess weight, of which 6.4% were obese, 64.3% presented high relative adiposity and 64.6% showed abdominal obesity. Regarding the physiometabolic profile, 10.0% had hypertension, 42.6% hypercholesterolemia, 9.4% high LDL and 10.6% low HDL, 9.4% hyperglycemia and 8.1% hypertriglyceridemia. The adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) was high in 29.7% and low in 14.7%. Most of the sample showed a good physical activity level. The AIP risk increased with higher obesity indicators and LDL cholesterol levels. There was an inverse relationship between the MedDiet adherence and vigorous physical activity and the risk of atherogenicity. Elevated rates of overweight, abdominal obesity and hypercholesterolemia were found, contributing to the atherogenic risk of plasma (AIP). This parameter was significantly associated with all anthropometric indicators and LDL cholesterol. Prevention plans on reducing excess fat and blood cholesterol levels are recommended to reduce cardiovascular risk in Spanish aviation pilots and ensure flight safety.",2022,cardiovascular
32590246,"The relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerosis.","Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) refers to the ability of the cardiopulmonary system to supply oxygen to skeletal muscles during exercise. Regular physical activity optimizes these systems by physiologic means that not only decrease cardiovascular risk factors but also independently affect mortality. Importantly, CRF is an integrative measure of the effects of its upstream risk factors including physical activity and genetics. In this review, we summarize the main methods that are frequently used to estimate CRF. We cite findings from the major studies on CRF, which demonstrate a beneficial effect on prevalent cardiovascular risk factor burden, subclinical atherosclerosis, and incident adverse outcomes including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancer. We conclude by suggesting the incorporation of CRF into clinical decision-making given the prognostic information it provides.",2020,cardiovascular
40681986,Lifestyle modifications and control of cardiovascular risk factors in older adults with hypertension: from NHANES 1999-2018.,"Self-management of hypertension is particularly emphasized for older patients. Specifically, it is critical that initiatives regarding lifestyle modifications be applied to reduce the cardiovascular burden of hypertension among the elderly population. We included participants aged 65 years or older with hypertension from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) years 1999-2018 to analyze the adherence to lifestyle recommendations and the control of cardiovascular risk factors. Recommended lifestyle behaviors and targets for cardiovascular risk factor controls were defined according to the clinical guidelines for the management of hypertension. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to identify factors associated with nonadherence. Of 10,162 participants (mean age, 74.45 years) included, 4350 (42.81%) had controlled blood pressure. Adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors varied among respondents. Smoking cessation (88.82%) and alcohol reduction (74.11%) were relatively high, whereas adherence to physical activity (14.57%), low salt diet (36.81%), and fiber intake (12.87%) were significantly lower. A significant proportion of respondents achieved target levels for LDL-C (76.00%) and HbA1c (72.49%), whereas fewer participants met BMI (25.02%) and waist circumference (31.26%) goals for cardiovascular risk factor control. After multivariable adjustment, male gender (OR: 1.53 [1.09-2.17]), non-Hispanic black race (OR: 1.85 [1.06-3.24]), metabolic syndrome status (no vs. yes, OR: 0.67 [0.47-0.94]), and chronic kidney disease status (no vs. yes, OR: 0.63 [0.41-0.97]) were associated with increased odds of unhealthy lifestyle, whereas male gender (OR: 1.37 [1.04-1.80]), high socioeconomic status (OR: 1.61 [1.05-2.49]), metabolic syndrome status (no vs. yes, OR: 0.03 [0.02-0.04]), and diabetes mellitus status (no vs. yes, OR: 0.68 [0.49-0.96]) were associated with increased odds of uncontrolled cardiovascular risk. Adherence to physical activity and healthy diet, and control of central obesity are suboptimal among older patients with hypertension.

32342447,An Overview of the Beneficial Effects of Exercise on Health and Performance.,"Life expectancy is steadily increasing in modern societies, and so are noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and cancer, accounting for more than 70% of all deaths globally. The costs associated with these diseases are enormous, but it has been estimated that the majority of these noncommunicable diseases are preventable. In addition to an unhealthy diet, tobacco use, and harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity is a key risk factor. Consequently, physical activity is a logical remedy, and in this chapter an overview of the numerous beneficial effects of physical activity on health and performance is given.The chapter is divided into three parts: First, the basics of physical activity and exercise are discussed, for instance exercise classification, exercise intensity operationalization, energy supply, and the acute effects of exercise such as blood flow redistribution and increased cardiac output. In the second part, the effects of exercise on physical performance are summarized. Specifically, it is discussed how endurance, strength, power, and balance can be improved. This discussion includes recommendations regarding the type, intensity, and duration of the exercise leading to improvements in one of these aspects of physical performance, as well as the mechanisms causing these adaptations. In the third part, the beneficial effects of physical activity on physical and mental health are outlined, with particular attention to cardiovascular diseases, the metabolic syndrome, musculoskeletal diseases, mood, anxiety, depression, and dementia.It can be concluded that with adequate programming, regular physical activity is an effective way to improve physical performance, improve physical and mental health, and reduce the risk factors for many noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and depression. In contrast to medication, physical exercise has no negative side effects, costs very little, and targets many health issues at once. If the multitude of beneficial effects of regular exercise were to be combined in a single low-cost drug, it would be prescribed for almost all types of physical and mental health issues.",2020,cardiovascular
34578831,"Association of Diet, Physical Activity Guidelines and Cardiometabolic Risk Markers in Children.","The aim was to identify different dietary and physical activity (PA) patterns in 5- to 14-year-old children with a high prevalence of overweight and obesity using cluster analysis based on their adherence to the Spanish Society of Community Nutrition dietary guidelines and levels of PA, and to determine their associations with age, sex, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk markers. In 549 children, hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify subgroups with similar adherence to dietary recommendations and level of PA. Three clusters were identified: Cluster 1, with the lowest level of vigorous PA and adherence to dietary recommendations; Cluster 2, with the lowest levels of moderate and vigorous PA and the highest adherence to dietary recommendations; and Cluster 3, with the highest level of PA, especially vigorous PA and a medium level adherence to dietary recommendations. Cluster 3 had lower total body fat and higher lean body mass percentages than Cluster 2. Cluster 2 had lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than Cluster 1. The results from our study suggest that it is important to consider adherence to PA recommendations together with adherence to dietary guidelines to understand patterns of obesogenic habits in pediatric populations with high prevalence of overweight and obesity.",2021,cardiovascular
38971538,Association of life's essential 8 with risk of recurrent cardiovascular events among patients with coronary heart disease.,"To examine the association of Life's Essential 8 (LE8) with the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events among patients with CHD. This prospective cohort study included 11,997 patients with CHD from the UK Biobank. The LE8 score was generated using five lifestyle factors (diet, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, and sleep) and three biological factors (blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure). LE8 score ranged from 0 to 100 and was categorized into quartiles. Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI (confidence interval). During a median follow up of 12.5 years, we documented 3366 recurrent cardiovascular events, 1068 myocardial infarction, 1829 heart failure events, 703 strokes, and 934 cardiovascular deaths. The multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CI) for the highest versus the lowest quartile of LE8 score was 0.57 (0.50, 0.65) for recurrent cardiovascular events, 0.66 (0.52, 0.83) for myocardial infarction, 0.54 (0.45, 0.67) for heart failure, 0.50 (0.36, 0.68) for stroke, and 0.46 (0.37, 0.56) for cardiovascular death. Furthermore, the population attributable fraction of the lowest to the highest quartile of LE8 score were ranged from 16.2% to 32.5% for the various cardiovascular outcomes. In addition, biomarkers including renal function and inflammation collectively explained 47.6%-87.7% of the associations between the lifestyle factors and recurrent cardiovascular events. Better cardiovascular health as measured by LE8 was associated with significantly lower risk of recurrent cardiovascular events among patients with CHD. Clinicians should prioritize educating patients with CHD on the importance of optimal cardiovascular health for secondary prevention. In addition, our findings indicated significant mediation effect of biomarkers involving of glycemic control, renal function, liver function, lipid profile, and systemic inflammation on the associations between overall lifestyle factors and recurrent cardiovascular events.",2024,cardiovascular
40614606,Dietary inflammatory index and the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality: A prospective cohort study of Chinese community-dwelling older adults.,"Inflammation is a contributory factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diet can modulate inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the association between dietary inflammatory index (DII) and CVD outcomes, and the mediating roles of cardiovascular risk factors. A prospective cohort study. A total of 3,013 Chinese community-dwelling older adults aged ≥65 years without CVD were included between 2001 and 2003 in Hong Kong. DII was calculated using a 280-item validated food frequency questionnaire. CVD outcomes included incident CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and CVD mortality, which were obtained from official records. Cox proportional hazards models examined the association between tertiles of DII and CVD outcomes. Mediation analysis explored the mediating roles of cardiovascular risk factors, including inflammatory biomarkers, impaired renal function, abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI), obesity, central obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. There were 263 CVD cases, 147 CHD cases, and 130 strokes during a median follow-up of 5.7 years. There were 277 CVD deaths during a median follow-up of 16.8 years. The highest tertile of DII was associated with increased risks of CVD incidence (HR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.05-1.96) and CVD mortality (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.03-2.03) compared with the lowest tertile. No significant associations were found for CHD and stroke. Impaired renal function, abnormal ABI, and hyperhomocysteinemia mediated the effects of a pro-inflammatory diet on CVD risk, with mediated proportions ranging from 3.68% to 7.78%. A pro-inflammatory diet increased the risks of CVD incidence and mortality, mediated by impaired renal function, abnormal ABI, and hyperhomocysteinemia.",2025,cardiovascular
34769060,Pathophysiological Molecular Mechanisms of Obesity: A Link between MAFLD and NASH with Cardiovascular Diseases.,"Obesity is now a worldwide epidemic ensuing an increase in comorbidities' prevalence, such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes (T2D), metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), autoimmune diseases, and some cancers, CVD being one of the main causes of death in the world. Several studies provide evidence for an association between MAFLD and atherosclerosis and cardio-metabolic disorders, including CVDs such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Therefore, the combination of MAFLD/NASH is associated with vascular risk and CVD progression, but the underlying mechanisms linking MAFLD/NASH and CVD are still under investigation. Several underlying mechanisms may probably be involved, including hepatic/systemic insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, as well as pro-atherogenic, pro-coagulant, and pro-inflammatory mediators released from the steatotic/inflamed liver. MAFLD is strongly associated with insulin resistance, which is involved in its pathogenesis and progression to NASH. Insulin resistance is a major cardiovascular risk factor in subjects without diabetes. However, T2D has been considered the most common link between MAFLD/NASH and CVD. This review summarizes the evidence linking obesity with MAFLD, NASH, and CVD, considering the pathophysiological molecular mechanisms involved in these diseases. We also discuss the association of MAFLD and NASH with the development and progression of CVD, including structural and functional cardiac alterations, and pharmacological strategies to treat MAFLD/NASH and cardiovascular prevention.",2021,cardiovascular
36628975,Age-Dependent Association Between Modifiable Risk Factors and Incident Cardiovascular Disease.,"Background There have been limited data examining the age-dependent relationship of wide-range risk factors with the incidence of each subtype of cardiovascular disease (CVD) event. We assessed age-related associations between modifiable risk factors and the incidence of CVD. Methods and Results We analyzed 3 027 839 participants without a CVD history enrolled in the JMDC Claims Database (mean age, 44.8±11.0 years; 57.6% men). Each participant was categorized as aged 20 to 49 years (n=2 008 559), 50 to 59 years (n=712 273), and 60 to 75 years (n=307 007). Using Cox proportional hazards models and the relative risk reduction, we identified associations between risk factors and incident CVD, consisting of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, and heart failure (HF). We assessed whether the association of risk factors for developing CVD would be modified by age category. Over a mean follow-up of 1133 days, 6315 myocardial infarction, 56 447 angina pectoris, 28 079 stroke, and 56 369 HF events were recorded. The incidence of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, and HF increased with age category. Hazard ratios of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes in the multivariable Cox regression analyses for myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, and HF decreased with age category. The relative risk reduction of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes for CVD events decreased with age category. For example, the relative risk reduction of hypertension for HF decreased from 59.2% in participants aged 20 to 49 years to 38.1% in those aged 60 to 75 years. Conclusions The contribution of modifiable risk factor to the development of CVD is greater in younger compared with older individuals. Preventive efforts for risk factor modification may be more effective in younger people.",2023,cardiovascular

Participants included 4521 adults from the 2013 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey physical activity monitoring examination. Wrist-worn ActiGraph GT3X+ data were used to estimate RARs. Multivariable logistic models evaluated associations of RARs with prevalent CVD, hypertension, obesity, and central adiposity. Participants (mean age, 49 years) in the highest versus lowest tertile of relative amplitude (greater circadian rhythmicity) had 39% to 62% lower odds of prevalent CVD, hypertension, obesity, and central adiposity. A more active wake period was associated with 19% to 72% lower CVD, hypertension, obesity, and central adiposity odds. Higher interdaily stability (regular sleep-wake and rest-activity patterns) was related to 52% and 23% lower CVD and obesity odds, respectively. In contrast, participants in the highest versus lowest tertile of intradaily variability (fragmented RAR and inefficient sleep) had >3-fold and 24% higher CVD and obesity odds, respectively. A later and less restful sleep period was associated with 36% to 2-fold higher CVD, hypertension, obesity, and central adiposity odds. A statistically significant linear trend was observed for all associations (<i>P</i>-trend<0.05). A robust, stable, and less fragmented RAR, an active wake period, and an earlier and more restful sleep period are associated with lower prevalent CVD, hypertension, obesity, and central adiposity, with evidence of a dose-response relationship. The magnitude, timing, and regularity of sleep-wake and rest-activity patterns may be important targets for reducing cardiovascular risk.",2024,cardiovascular
36555535,Clinical Evidence on the Potential Beneficial Effects of Probiotics and Prebiotics in Cardiovascular Disease.,"The 'gut microbiome'-the hundreds of trillions of bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract-serves several functions. The gut microbiome includes all the microorganisms, bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi in the gastrointestinal tract and their genetic material. It helps digest indigestible foods and produces nutrients. Through the metabolism of sugars and proteins, it helps the intestinal barrier, the immune system, and metabolism. Some bacteria, such as those in the gut microbiome, cause disease, but others are essential to our health. These ""good"" microbes protect us from pathogens. Numerous studies have linked an unhealthy gut microbiome to obesity, insulin resistance, depression, and cardiometabolic risk factors. To maximize probiotic benefits in each case, knowledge of probiotic bacterial strains and how to consume them should be increased. This study aims to examine the benefits of probiotic and prebiotic organisms on cardiovascular health, specifically on heart disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, and hypertension. To complete the research, a literature review was conducted by gathering clinical studies and data.

34291663,[Primary and Secondary Stroke Prevention: Physical Activity].,"Primary and Secondary Stroke Prevention: Physical Activity <b>Abstract.</b> The evidence of positive effects of physical activity in primary and secondary stroke prevention has steadily increased in the last years. It is established that physical activity on a regular basis has a positive influence on the majority of vascular risk factors (e. g. on obesity, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation and so on). After a stroke, one of the main challenges is reducing the risk of a recurrent event and its possible consequences. Other important challenges are improving impaired brain functions, quality of life and independence in the activity of daily living as well as reintegration into the community [1]. Stroke-induced impairment of brain function has, besides its effects on motor, sensory, visual and speech functions, an influence on cognition and mood, which are determinants of physical activity after stroke [2]. Type, intensity and amount of physical activity have to be adjusted according to comorbidities and, if present, to residual neurologic impairments after a stroke.",2021,cardiovascular
26204494,Living longer by sitting less and moving more.,"Regular exercise, physical fitness and sedentary behaviours are each known to be associated with cardiovascular and total mortality. This review evaluates recent research on these associations and its implications for guidelines on physical activity. In several large cohort studies, modest levels of exercise, much less than recommended in current guidelines, were associated with lower mortality. Avoiding prolonged sitting has also been associated with lower mortality risk. Most research suggests graded decreases in long-term mortality with an increase in usual physical activity and fitness. However, at very high exercise levels, these benefits may be attenuated, particularly in patients with known coronary heart disease. In sedentary persons, a modest increase in physical activity and avoiding prolonged sitting are likely to have important health benefits. Further research is needed to determine the most effective strategies for increasing physical activity.",2015,cardiovascular
27013138,MicroRNA: A new therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular diseases.,"Myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, and hypertension are the most common heart-related diseases that affect both the heart and the blood vessels. Multiple independent risk factors have been shown to be responsible for cardiovascular diseases. The combination of a healthy diet, exercise, and smoking cessation keeps these risk factors in check and helps maintain homeostasis. The dynamic monolayer endothelial cell integrity and cell-cell communication are the fundamental mechanisms in maintaining homeostasis. Recently, it has been revealed that small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a critical role in regulation of genes involved in either posttranscriptional or pretranslational modifications. They also control diverse biological functions like development, differentiation, growth, and metabolism. Among ncRNAs, the short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been extensively studied, but their specific functions remain largely unknown. In recent years, miRNAs are efficiently studied as one of the important candidates for involvement in most biological processes and have been implicated in many human diseases. Thus, the identification and the respective targets of miRNAs may provide novel molecular insight and new therapeutic strategies to treat diseases. This review summarizes the recent developments and insight on the role of miRNAs in cardiovascular disease prognosis, diagnostic and clinical applications.",2016,cardiovascular

Patients with CVDs and CBVDs co-morbid with mood disorders, especially bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), suffer reduced quality-of-life and significant disability adjusted for years of life and mortality. The relationship between CVDs/CBVDs and mood disorders is likely to be bidirectional. Evidence for shared genetic risk of pathways involved in stress reaction, serotonin or dopamine signalling, circadian rhythms, and energy balance was reported in genome-wide association studies. There is some evidence of a neuroprotective effect of various antidepressants, which may be boosted by physical exercise, especially by aerobic ones. Patients with CVDs/CBVDs should be routinely attentively evaluated for the presence of mood disorders, with tools aimed at detecting both symptoms of depression and of hypomania/mania. Behavioural lifestyle interventions targeting nutrition and exercise, coping strategies, and attitudes towards health should be routinely provided to patients with mood disorders, to prevent the risk of CVDs/CBVDs.

Evidence of breaking sedentary behaviour and global recommendations were investigated. Potential unanswered questions regarding sedentary behaviour and physical activity during lockdown were explored. Five systematic reviews and six prospective trials explored the effect of sedentarism affecting chronic disease through potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Sedentary behaviour especially prolonged sitting is found to be a pleiotropic risk factor with altered energy expenditure, adipogenic signalling, immunomodulation, autonomic stability and hormonal dysregulation perpetuating underlying chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health disorders.
