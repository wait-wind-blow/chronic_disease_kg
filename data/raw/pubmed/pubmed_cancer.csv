35361331,Risk Factors for Colorectal Polyps and Cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy in the U.S. and worldwide. Most CRC cases arise from precancerous adenomatous and serrated polyps. Established risk factors for conventional adenomas and CRC include age, male sex, family history, obesity and physical inactivity, and red meat intake. White race and tobacco and alcohol use are important risk factors for serrated polyps, which have a distinct risk factor profile compared to conventional adenomas. A history of abdominopelvic radiation, acromegaly, hereditary hemochromatosis, or prior ureterosigmoidostomy also increases CRC risk. Understanding these risk factors allows for targeted screening of high-risk groups to reduce CRC incidence.",2022,cancer
37743572,Physical activity and cancer risk: a dose-response analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.,"Adopting a healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity, is widely believed to decrease cancer risk. This study aimed to quantitatively establish the dose-response relationships between total physical activity and the risk of breast, colon, lung, gastric, and liver cancers. A systematic review and dose-response analysis were conducted using PubMed and Embase from January 1, 1980 to March 20, 2023. Prospective cohort studies that examined the association between physical activity and the risks of any of the 5 outcomes were included. The search was confined to publications in the English language with a specific focus on human studies. Physical activity is standardized by using the data from US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) and the Global Burden of Disease 2019 database. A total of 98 studies, involving a combined population of 16,418,361 individuals, were included in the analysis. Among the included studies, 57 focused on breast cancer, 17 on lung cancer, 23 on colon cancer, 5 on gastric cancer, and 7 on liver cancer. Overall, elevated levels of physical activity exhibited an inverse correlation with the risk of cancer. The dose-response curve for lung cancer exhibited a non-linear pattern, with the greatest benefit risk reduction observed at 13,200 MET-minutes/week of physical activity, resulting in a 14.7% reduction in risk (relative risk 0.853, uncertainty interval 0.798 to 0.912) compared to the inactive population. In contrast, the dose-response curves for colon, gastric, breast, and liver cancers showed linear associations, indicating that heightened levels of total physical activity were consistently associated with reduced cancer risks. However, the increase in physical activity yielded a smaller risk reduction for colon and gastric cancers compared to breast and liver cancers. Compared to individuals with insufficient activity (total activity level < 600 MET-minutes/week), individuals with high levels of activity (≥ 8,000 MET-minutes/week) experienced a 10.3% (0.897, 0.860 to 0.934) risk reduction for breast cancer; 5.9% (0.941, 0.884 to 1.001) for lung cancer; 7.1% (0.929, 0.909 to 0.949) for colon cancer; 5.1% (0.949, 0.908 to 0.992) for gastric cancer; 17.1% (0.829, 0.760 to 0.903) for liver cancer. This study demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between total physical activity and the risk of breast, gastric, liver, colon, and lung cancers.",2023,cancer
35057525,The Role of Diet in Prognosis among Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Dietary Patterns and Diet Interventions.,"Cancer survival continues to improve in high-income countries, partly explained by advances in screening and treatment. Previous studies have mainly examined the relationship between individual dietary components and cancer prognosis in tumours with good therapeutic response (breast, colon and prostate cancers). The aim of this review is to assess qualitatively (and quantitatively where appropriate) the associations of dietary patterns and cancer prognosis from published prospective cohort studies, as well as the effect of diet interventions by means of randomised controlled trials (RCT). A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, and a total of 35 prospective cohort studies and 14 RCT published between 2011 and 2021 were selected. Better overall diet quality was associated with improved survival among breast and colorectal cancer survivors; adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated to lower risk of mortality in colorectal and prostate cancer survivors. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model showed that higher versus lower diet quality was associated with a 23% reduction in overall mortality in breast cancer survivors. There was evidence that dietary interventions, generally combined with physical activity, improved overall quality of life, though most studies were in breast cancer survivors. Further cohort and intervention studies in other cancers are needed to make more specific recommendations.",2022,cancer

25651787,"Global cancer statistics, 2012.","Cancer constitutes an enormous burden on society in more and less economically developed countries alike. The occurrence of cancer is increasing because of the growth and aging of the population, as well as an increasing prevalence of established risk factors such as smoking, overweight, physical inactivity, and changing reproductive patterns associated with urbanization and economic development. Based on GLOBOCAN estimates, about 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide. Over the years, the burden has shifted to less developed countries, which currently account for about 57% of cases and 65% of cancer deaths worldwide. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among males in both more and less developed countries, and has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among females in more developed countries; breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among females in less developed countries. Other leading causes of cancer death in more developed countries include colorectal cancer among males and females and prostate cancer among males. In less developed countries, liver and stomach cancer among males and cervical cancer among females are also leading causes of cancer death. Although incidence rates for all cancers combined are nearly twice as high in more developed than in less developed countries in both males and females, mortality rates are only 8% to 15% higher in more developed countries. This disparity reflects regional differences in the mix of cancers, which is affected by risk factors and detection practices, and/or the availability of treatment. Risk factors associated with the leading causes of cancer death include tobacco use (lung, colorectal, stomach, and liver cancer), overweight/obesity and physical inactivity (breast and colorectal cancer), and infection (liver, stomach, and cervical cancer). A substantial portion of cancer cases and deaths could be prevented by broadly applying effective prevention measures, such as tobacco control, vaccination, and the use of early detection tests.",2015,cancer
25575572,"Nutrients, foods, and colorectal cancer prevention.","Diet has an important role in the development of colorectal cancer. In the past few decades, findings from extensive epidemiologic and experimental investigations have linked consumption of several foods and nutrients to the risk of colorectal neoplasia. Calcium, fiber, milk, and whole grains have been associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer, and red meat and processed meat have been associated with an increased risk. There is substantial evidence for the potential chemopreventive effects of vitamin D, folate, fruits, and vegetables. Nutrients and foods also may interact, as a dietary pattern, to influence colorectal cancer risk. Diet likely influences colorectal carcinogenesis through several interacting mechanisms. These include the direct effects on immune responsiveness and inflammation, and the indirect effects of overnutrition and obesity-risk factors for colorectal cancer. Emerging evidence also implicates the gut microbiota as an important effector in the relationship between diet and cancer. Dietary modification therefore has the promise of reducing colorectal cancer incidence.",2015,cancer
37847493,The Effect of Diet on Breast Cancer Recurrence: The DIANA-5 Randomized Trial.,"The DIANA-5 randomized controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of a diet based on Mediterranean and macrobiotic traditions (macro-Mediterranean diet) in reducing breast cancer recurrence. The DIANA-5 study involved 1,542 patients with breast cancer at high risk of recurrence because of estrogen receptor-negative cancer, or metabolic syndrome, or high plasma levels of insulin or testosterone. Women were randomly assigned to an active dietary intervention (IG) or a control group (CG). Both groups received the 2007 American Institute for Cancer Research/World Cancer Research Fund recommendations for cancer prevention. The intervention consisted of meetings with kitchen classes, community meals, and dietary recommendations. Recommended foods included whole grain cereals, legumes, soy products, vegetables, fruit, nuts, olive oil, and fish. Foods to be avoided were refined products, potatoes, sugar and desserts, red and processed meat, dairy products, and alcoholic drinks. A compliance Dietary Index was defined by the difference between recommended and discouraged foods. Over the 5 years of follow-up, 95 patients of the IG and 98 of the CG developed breast cancer recurrence [HR = 0.99; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69-1.40]. The analysis by compliance to the dietary recommendations (IG and CG together) showed that the women in the upper tertile of Dietary Index change had an HR of recurrence of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.36-0.92) compared with women in the lower tertile. The DIANA-5 dietary intervention trial failed to show a reduction in breast cancer recurrence, although self-reported diet at year 1 in IG and CG combined showed a protective association with the higher Dietary Index change.

37929890,[Nutrition in breast cancer genesis].,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent tumor in women, ranking first in incidence and mortality in many countries. Although the causes of breast cancer are complex and multifactorial, nutritional factors and those related to nutritional status play an important role in the development of the disease. In this way, factors that increase breast cancer risk have been identified, such as weight gain, the amount of adipose tissue, waist circumference, alcohol consumption or the consumption of red meat and processed meat, while other factors have been identified that reduce the risk, such as eating fruits and vegetables. Nutritional factors or factors that depend on the state of nutrition are modifiable and preventable, so they must be considered when designing effective prevention programs.",2023,cancer
31586566,"Influence of the Gut Microbiome, Diet, and Environment on Risk of Colorectal Cancer.","Researchers have discovered associations between elements of the intestinal microbiome (including specific microbes, signaling pathways, and microbiota-related metabolites) and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is unclear whether changes in the intestinal microbiome contribute to the development of sporadic CRC or result from it. Changes in the intestinal microbiome can mediate or modify the effects of environmental factors on risk of CRC. Factors that affect risk of CRC also affect the intestinal microbiome, including overweight and obesity; physical activity; and dietary intake of fiber, whole grains, and red and processed meat. These factors alter microbiome structure and function, along with the metabolic and immune pathways that mediate CRC development. We review epidemiologic and laboratory evidence for the influence of the microbiome, diet, and environmental factors on CRC incidence and outcomes. Based on these data, features of the intestinal microbiome might be used for CRC screening and modified for chemoprevention and treatment. Integrated prospective studies are urgently needed to investigate these strategies.",2020,cancer
26780279,Health Risks Associated with Meat Consumption: A Review of Epidemiological Studies.,"Recent evidence from large prospective US and European cohort studies and from meta-analyses of epidemiological studies indicates that the long-term consumption of increasing amounts of red meat and particularly of processed meat is associated with an increased risk of total mortality, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes, in both men and women. The association persists after inclusion of known confounding factors, such as age, race, BMI, history, smoking, blood pressure, lipids, physical activity and multiple nutritional parameters in multivariate analysis. The association has not always been noted with red meat, and it has been absent with white meat. There is evidence of several mechanisms for the observed adverse effects that might be involved, however, their individual role is not defined at present. It is concluded that recommendations for the consumption of unprocessed red meat and particularly of processed red meat should be more restrictive than existing recommendations. Restrictive recommendations should not be applied to subjects above about 70 years of age, as the studies quoted herein did not examine this age group, and the inclusion of sufficient protein supply (e. g. in the form of meat) is particularly important in the elderly.",2015,cancer
28935150,Mediterranean diet and colorectal cancer: A systematic review.,"Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, especially in developed countries where an estimated 60% of all cases occur. There is evidence of a higher risk for CRC in Western society, where people tend to eat more red and processed meat than those living along the Mediterranean coast, who have a decreased overall cancer mortality, which is correlated to their eating habits, such as Mediterranean diet. The aim of this review was to evaluate the correlation between three components of the Mediterranean diet (olive oil, red wine, and tomatoes) and incidence and progression of colorectal cancer. As such, we conducted a literature search using keywords ""colorectal cancer,"" ""dietary pattern,"" ""Mediterranean diet,"" ""olive oil,"" ""protective effects,"" ""resveratrol,"" and ""lycopene."" Olive oil polyphenols, red wine resveratrol, and tomato lycopene showed several characteristics in vitro that interfere with molecular cancer pathways. At the same time, many clinical studies have reported an association of these components with a reduction in cancer initiation and progression. More clinical studies are needed to identify the precise dose and administration of single agents or their combination to produce a coadjutant treatment to those already applied in chemoprevention and oncologic treatment.",2017,cancer
34789537,Fasting-Mimicking Diet Is Safe and Reshapes Metabolism and Antitumor Immunity in Patients with Cancer.,"In tumor-bearing mice, cyclic fasting or fasting-mimicking diets (FMD) enhance the activity of antineoplastic treatments by modulating systemic metabolism and boosting antitumor immunity. Here we conducted a clinical trial to investigate the safety and biological effects of cyclic, five-day FMD in combination with standard antitumor therapies. In 101 patients, the FMD was safe, feasible, and resulted in a consistent decrease of blood glucose and growth factor concentration, thus recapitulating metabolic changes that mediate fasting/FMD anticancer effects in preclinical experiments. Integrated transcriptomic and deep-phenotyping analyses revealed that FMD profoundly reshapes anticancer immunity by inducing the contraction of peripheral blood immunosuppressive myeloid and regulatory T-cell compartments, paralleled by enhanced intratumor Th1/cytotoxic responses and an enrichment of IFNγ and other immune signatures associated with better clinical outcomes in patients with cancer. Our findings lay the foundations for phase II/III clinical trials aimed at investigating FMD antitumor efficacy in combination with standard antineoplastic treatments. SIGNIFICANCE: Cyclic FMD is well tolerated and causes remarkable systemic metabolic changes in patients with different tumor types and treated with concomitant antitumor therapies. In addition, the FMD reshapes systemic and intratumor immunity, finally activating several antitumor immune programs. Phase II/III clinical trials are needed to investigate FMD antitumor activity/efficacy.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1</i>.",2022,cancer
30031175,"Environmental Factors, Gut Microbiota, and Colorectal Cancer Prevention.","The substantial burden of colorectal cancer and increasing trend in young adults highlight the importance of lifestyle modification as a complement to screening for colorectal cancer prevention. Several dietary and lifestyle factors have been implicated in the development of colorectal cancer, possibly through the intricate metabolic and inflammatory mechanisms. Likewise, as a key metabolic and immune regulator, the gut microbiota has been recognized to play an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis. Increasing data support that environmental factors are crucial determinants for the gut microbial composition and function, whose alterations induce changes in the host gene expression, metabolic regulation, and local and systemic immune response, thereby influencing cancer development. Here, we review the epidemiologic and mechanistic evidence regarding the links between diet and lifestyle and the gut microbiota in the development of colorectal cancer. We focus on factors for which substantial data support their importance for colorectal cancer and their potential role in the gut microbiota, including overweight and obesity, physical activity, dietary patterns, fiber, red and processed meat, marine omega-3 fatty acid, alcohol, and smoking. We also briefly describe other colorectal cancer-preventive factors for which the links with the gut microbiota have been suggested but remain to be mechanistically characterized, including vitamin D status, dairy consumption, and metformin use. Given limitations in available evidence, we highlight the need for further investigations in the relationship between environmental factors, gut microbiota, and colorectal cancer, which may lead to development and clinical translation of potential microbiota-based strategies for cancer prevention.",2019,cancer
33401525,Dietary Factors Modulating Colorectal Carcinogenesis.,"The development of colorectal cancer, responsible for 9% of cancer-related deaths, is favored by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The modification of diet and lifestyle may modify the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and prevent neoplasia in up to 50% of cases. The Western diet, characterized by a high intake of fat, red meat and processed meat has emerged as an important contributor. Conversely, a high intake of dietary fiber partially counteracts the unfavorable effects of meat through multiple mechanisms, including reduced intestinal transit time and dilution of carcinogenic compounds. Providing antioxidants (e.g., vitamins C and E) and leading to increased intraluminal production of protective fermentation products, like butyrate, represent other beneficial and useful effects of a fiber-rich diet. Protective effects on the risk of developing colorectal cancer have been also advocated for some specific micronutrients like vitamin D, selenium, and calcium. Diet-induced modifications of the gut microbiota modulate colonic epithelial cell homeostasis and carcinogenesis. This can have, under different conditions, opposite effects on the risk of CRC, through the production of mutagenic and carcinogenic agents or, conversely, of protective compounds. The aim of this review is to summarize the most recent evidence on the role of diet as a potential risk factor for the development of colorectal malignancies, as well as providing possible prevention dietary strategies.",2021,cancer

Data from the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health conducted in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa from 2007 to 2010 and the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999 to 2011 were used to map domain specific physical activity (reported in included studies) to total activity.  Prospective cohort studies examining the associations between physical activity (any domain) and at least one of the five diseases studied.  174 articles were identified: 35 for breast cancer, 19 for colon cancer, 55 for diabetes, 43 for ischemic heart disease, and 26 for ischemic stroke (some articles included multiple outcomes). Although higher levels of total physical activity were significantly associated with lower risk for all outcomes, major gains occurred at lower levels of activity (up to 3000-4000 metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes/week). For example, individuals with a total activity level of 600 MET minutes/week (the minimum recommended level) had a 2% lower risk of diabetes compared with those reporting no physical activity. An increase from 600 to 3600 MET minutes/week reduced the risk by an additional 19%. The same amount of increase yielded much smaller returns at higher levels of activity: an increase of total activity from 9000 to 12 000 MET minutes/week reduced the risk of diabetes by only 0.6%. Compared with insufficiently active individuals (total activity <600 MET minutes/week), the risk reduction for those in the highly active category (≥8000 MET minutes/week) was 14% (relative risk 0.863, 95% uncertainty interval 0.829 to 0.900) for breast cancer; 21% (0.789, 0.735 to 0.850) for colon cancer; 28% (0.722, 0.678 to 0.768) for diabetes; 25% (0.754, 0.704 to 0.809) for ischemic heart disease; and 26% (0.736, 0.659 to 0.811) for ischemic stroke.  People who achieve total physical activity levels several times higher than the current recommended minimum level have a significant reduction in the risk of the five diseases studied.

35000418,Risk Factors for the Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer.,"Colorectal cancer defined as cancer of the colon or rectum, is the third most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and the second in women, and, according to the World Health Organization database GLOBOCAN, it accounts for nearly 1.4 million new cases annually worldwide. The occurrence of colorectal cancer is associated with nonmodifiable risk factors, including age and hereditary factors, as well as with modifiable environmental and lifestyle factors. The study included 800 patients, 400 diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 400 within the control group, who gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. Patients with cancer other than colorectal cancer were randomly selected for control group I, and patients with no cancer diagnosis were selected for control group II. The method used was a case-control study - an observational and analytical study with a control group, conducted among patients of the Clinical Oncology Centre and the Provincial Hospital in the years 2019-2020. The study comparing the exposure was carried out in a group of people who developed the endpoint, that is colorectal cancer, with the exposure in a well-matched group of controls who did not reach the endpoint. Assessment of activity and BMI was used according to WHO recommendations, as well as the expert system. The data were tested for the distribution and the homogeneity of variance was validated before applying the parameter tests. Comparison of quantitative variables between groups was performed using ANOVA. The mean age of the patients was 64.53 ± 8.86 years, of the control group I - 59.64 ± 9.33 and the control group II - 57.5 (7.83). There was a strong positive association between the incidence of ulcerative colitis and the risk of colorectal cancer (<i>P</i> < .01). Among obese subjects, the risk of developing colorectal cancer was 1.27 (95% CI, 1.06-1.53) compared with nonobese subjects. A strong positive relationship was found between low physical activity converted to metabolic equivalent of MET effort per week and the risk of colorectal cancer (<i>P</i> < .001). The relative risk for current smokers was 2.17 (95% CI 1.79-2.66). There was an association between higher fat consumption and higher red meat consumption and the risk of developing colorectal cancer (<i>P</i> < .01). Obesity, low physical activity, active and passive smoking and high salt and red meat consumption have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. These findings provide further evidence of the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.",2022,cancer
29274927,Red and processed meat consumption and breast cancer: UK Biobank cohort study and meta-analysis.,"Red and processed meat may be risk factors for breast cancer due to their iron content, administration of oestrogens to cattle or mutagens created during cooking. We studied the associations in UK Biobank and then included the results in a meta-analysis of published cohort studies. UK Biobank, a general population cohort study, recruited participants aged 40-69 years. Incident breast cancer was ascertained via linkage to routine hospital admission, cancer registry and death certificate data. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore the associations between red and processed meat consumption and breast cancer. Previously published cohort studies were identified from a systematic review using PubMed and Ovid and a meta-analysis conducted using a random effects model. Over a median of 7 years follow-up, 4819 of the 262,195 women developed breast cancer. The risk was increased in the highest tertile (>9 g/day) of processed meat consumption (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.35, p = 0.001). Collation with 10 previous cohort studies provided data on 40,257 incident breast cancers in 1.65 million women. On meta-analysis, processed meat consumption was associated with overall (relative risk [RR] 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11) and post-menopausal (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.15), but not pre-menopausal (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88-1.10), breast cancer. In UK Biobank and the meta-analysis, red meat consumption was not associated with breast cancer (adjusted HR 0.99 95% CI 0.88-1.12 and RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.08, respectively).

28759385,"Physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet, and cancer: an update and emerging new evidence.","The lifestyle factors of physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and diet are increasingly being studied for their associations with cancer. Physical activity is inversely associated with and sedentary behaviour is positively (and independently) associated with an increased risk of more than ten types of cancer, including colorectal cancer (and advanced adenomas), endometrial cancers, and breast cancer. The most consistent dietary risk factor for premalignant and invasive breast cancer is alcohol, whether consumed during early or late adult life, even at low levels. Epidemiological studies show that the inclusion of wholegrain, fibre, fruits, and vegetables within diets are associated with reduced cancer risk, with diet during early life (age <8 years) having the strongest apparent association with cancer incidence. However, randomised controlled trials of diet-related factors have not yet shown any conclusive associations between diet and cancer incidence. Obesity is a key contributory factor associated with cancer risk and mortality, including in dose-response associations in endometrial and post-menopausal breast cancer, and in degree and duration of fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Obesity produces an inflammatory state, characterised by macrophages clustered around enlarged hypertrophied, dead, and dying adipocytes, forming crown-like structures. Increased concentrations of aromatase and interleukin 6 in inflamed breast tissue and an increased number of macrophages, compared with healthy tissue, are also observed in women with normal body mass index, suggesting a metabolic obesity state. Emerging randomised controlled trials of physical activity and dietary factors and mechanistic studies of immunity, inflammation, extracellular matrix mechanics, epigenetic or transcriptional regulation, protein translation, circadian disruption, and interactions of the multibiome with lifestyle factors will be crucial to advance this field.",2017,cancer
28205448,Association between red meat consumption and colon cancer: A systematic review of experimental results.,"A role for red and processed meat in the development of colorectal cancer has been proposed based largely on evidence from observational studies in humans, especially in those populations consuming a westernized diet. Determination of causation specifically by red or processed meat is contingent upon identification of plausible mechanisms that lead to colorectal cancer. We conducted a systematic review of the available evidence to determine the availability of plausible mechanistic data linking red and processed meat consumption to colorectal cancer risk. Forty studies using animal models or cell cultures met specified inclusion criteria, most of which were designed to examine the role of heme iron or heterocyclic amines in relation to colon carcinogenesis. Most studies used levels of meat or meat components well in excess of those found in human diets. Although many of the experiments used semi-purified diets designed to mimic the nutrient loads in current westernized diets, most did not include potential biologically active protective compounds present in whole foods. Because of these limitations in the existing literature, there is currently insufficient evidence to confirm a mechanistic link between the intake of red meat as part of a healthy dietary pattern and colorectal cancer risk. Impact statement Current recommendations to reduce colon cancer include the reduction or elimination of red or processed meats. These recommendations are based on data from epidemiological studies conducted among cultures where meat consumption is elevated and consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are reduced. This review evaluated experimental data exploring the putative mechanisms whereby red or processed meats may contribute to colon cancer. Most studies used levels of meat or meat-derived compounds that were in excess of those in human diets, even in cultures where meat intake is elevated. Experiments where protective dietary compounds were used to mitigate the extreme levels of meat and meat-derived compounds showed protection against colon cancer, with some essentially negating the impact of meat in the diet. It is essential that better-designed studies be conducted that use relevant concentrations of meat or meat-derived compounds in complex diets representative of the foods consumed by humans.",2017,cancer
30993317,Diet and colorectal cancer in UK Biobank: a prospective study.,"Most of the previous studies on diet and colorectal cancer were based on diets consumed during the 1990s. We used Cox-regression models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios for colorectal cancer by dietary factors in the UK Biobank study. Men and women aged 40-69 years at recruitment (2006-10) reported their diet on a short food-frequency questionnaire (n = 475 581). Dietary intakes were re-measured in a large sub-sample (n = 175 402) who completed an online 24-hour dietary assessment during follow-up. Trends in risk across the baseline categories were calculated by assigning re-measured intakes to allow for measurement error and changes in intake over time. During an average of 5.7 years of follow-up, 2609 cases of colorectal cancer occurred. Participants who reported consuming an average of 76 g/day of red and processed meat compared with 21 g/day had a 20% [95% confidence interval (CI): 4-37] higher risk of colorectal cancer. Participants in the highest fifth of intake of fibre from bread and breakfast cereals had a 14% (95% CI: 2-24) lower risk of colorectal cancer. Alcohol was associated with an 8% (95% CI: 4-12) higher risk per 10 g/day higher intake. Fish, poultry, cheese, fruit, vegetables, tea and coffee were not associated with colorectal-cancer risk. Consumption of red and processed meat at an average level of 76 g/d that meets the current UK government recommendation (≤90 g/day) was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Alcohol was also associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, whereas fibre from bread and breakfast cereals was associated with a reduced risk.",2020,cancer

33591366,Role of Diet in Colorectal Cancer Incidence: Umbrella Review of Meta-analyses of Prospective Observational Studies.,"Several meta-analyses have summarized evidence for the association between dietary factors and the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, to date, there has been little synthesis of the strength, precision, and quality of this evidence in aggregate. To grade the evidence from published meta-analyses of prospective observational studies that assessed the association of dietary patterns, specific foods, food groups, beverages (including alcohol), macronutrients, and micronutrients with the incidence of CRC. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from database inception to September 2019. Only meta-analyses of prospective observational studies with a cohort study design were eligible. Evidence of association was graded according to established criteria as follows: convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or not significant. From 9954 publications, 222 full-text articles (2.2%) were evaluated for eligibility, and 45 meta-analyses (20.3%) that described 109 associations between dietary factors and CRC incidence were selected. Overall, 35 of the 109 associations (32.1%) were nominally statistically significant using random-effects meta-analysis models; 17 associations (15.6%) demonstrated large heterogeneity between studies (I2 > 50%), whereas small-study effects were found for 11 associations (10.1%). Excess significance bias was not detected for any association between diet and CRC. The primary analysis identified 5 (4.6%) convincing, 2 (1.8%) highly suggestive, 10 (9.2%) suggestive, and 18 (16.5%) weak associations between diet and CRC, while there was no evidence for 74 (67.9%) associations. There was convincing evidence of an association of intake of red meat (high vs low) and alcohol (≥4 drinks/d vs 0 or occasional drinks) with the incidence of CRC and an inverse association of higher vs lower intakes of dietary fiber, calcium, and yogurt with CRC risk. The evidence for convincing associations remained robust following sensitivity analyses. This umbrella review found convincing evidence of an association between lower CRC risk and higher intakes of dietary fiber, dietary calcium, and yogurt and lower intakes of alcohol and red meat. More research is needed on specific foods for which evidence remains suggestive, including other dairy products, whole grains, processed meat, and specific dietary patterns.",2021,cancer
36541995,The Benefits of Exercise in Breast Cancer.,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women, accounting for nearly 30% of all cancers, while in men, it represents only 1% of cases. Breast cancer is the main cause of death for cancer, and its incidence and mortality vary according to patients' ethnicity, geographic region, and socioeconomic status. Due to the low prevalence of breast cancer among men and the scarcity of studies in the literature, exercises have been prescribed based on extrapolations from studies on female patients. Scientific evidence has suggested beneficial effects of physical exercises on breast cancer prevention, treatment, and post-treatment. In addition to combatting sedentary behavior, it is essential to maintain a healthy body weight, limit alcohol consumption, and follow a balanced diet, rich in fruit, vegetables, grains and fibers, and limited in red meat. The effects of exercises are not restricted to breast cancer, but extend to controlling modifiable risk factors, and reducing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.",2022,cancer
28956850,Precision Nutrition for Targeting Lipid Metabolism in Colorectal Cancer.,"Cancer is a multistage and multifactorial condition with genetic and environmental factors modulating tumorogenesis and disease progression. Nevertheless, cancer is preventable, as one third of cancer deaths could be avoided by modifying key risk factors. Nutrients can directly affect fundamental cellular processes and are considered among the most important risk factors in colorectal cancer (CRC). Red and processed meat, poultry consumption, fiber, and folate are the best-known diet components that interact with colorectal cancer susceptibility. In addition, the direct association of an unhealthy diet with obesity and dysbiosis opens new routes in the understanding of how daily diet nutrients could influence cancer prognosis. In the ""omics"" era, traditional nutrition has been naturally evolved to precision nutrition where technical developments have contributed to a more accurate discipline. In this sense, genomic and transcriptomic studies have been extensively used in precision nutrition approaches. However, the relation between CRC carcinogenesis and nutrition factors is more complex than originally expected. Together with classical diet-nutrition-related genes, nowadays, lipid-metabolism-related genes have acquired relevant interest in precision nutrition studies. Lipids regulate very diverse cellular processes from ATP synthesis and the activation of essential cell-signaling pathways to membrane organization and plasticity. Therefore, a wide range of tumorogenic steps can be influenced by lipid metabolism, both in primary tumours and distal metastasis. The extent to which genetic variants, together with the intake of specific dietary components, affect the risk of CRC is currently under investigation, and new therapeutic or preventive applications must be explored in CRC models. In this review, we will go in depth into the study of co-occurring events, which orchestrate CRC tumorogenesis and are essential for the evolution of precision nutrition paradigms. Likewise, we will discuss the application of precision nutrition approaches to target lipid metabolism in CRC.",2017,cancer
33271590,Intake of Various Food Groups and Risk of Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies.,"Despite increasing evidence for the association of food-based dietary patterns with breast cancer risk, knowledge about the shape of the relationship and the quality of meta-evidence are insufficient. We aimed to summarize the associations between food groups and risks of breast cancer. We performed a systematic literature search of the PubMed and Embase databases up to March 2020. We included cohort, case-cohort, nested case-control studies, and follow-up studies of randomized controlled trials that investigated the relationship between breast cancer risk and at least 1 of the following food groups: red meat, processed meat, fish, poultry, egg, vegetables, fruit, dairy product (overall, milk, yogurt, and cheese), grains/cereals, nuts, legumes, soy, and sugar-sweetened beverages. Summary risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a random-effects model for linear and nonlinear relationships. Inverse linear associations were observed for vegetables (RR per 100 g/d, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99), fruit (RR per 100 g/d, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99), cheese (RR per 30 g/d, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-1.00), and soy (RR per 30 g/d, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99), while positive associations were observed for red (RR per 100 g/d, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.18) and processed meat (RR per 50 g/d, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04-1.33). None of the other food groups were significantly associated with breast cancer risk. A nonlinear association was observed only for milk, such that the intake of >450 g/d increased the risk, while no association was observed for lower intake amounts. High intakes of vegetables, fruit, cheese, and soy products and low intakes of red and processed meat were associated with lower risks of breast cancer. However, causality cannot be inferred from these statistical correlations.",2021,cancer
33462452,Distinct metabolic programs established in the thymus control effector functions of γδ T cell subsets in tumor microenvironments.,"Metabolic programming controls immune cell lineages and functions, but little is known about γδ T cell metabolism. Here, we found that γδ T cell subsets making either interferon-γ (IFN-γ) or interleukin (IL)-17 have intrinsically distinct metabolic requirements. Whereas IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells were almost exclusively dependent on glycolysis, IL-17<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells strongly engaged oxidative metabolism, with increased mitochondrial mass and activity. These distinct metabolic signatures were surprisingly imprinted early during thymic development and were stably maintained in the periphery and within tumors. Moreover, pro-tumoral IL-17<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells selectively showed high lipid uptake and intracellular lipid storage and were expanded in obesity and in tumors of obese mice. Conversely, glucose supplementation enhanced the antitumor functions of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells and reduced tumor growth upon adoptive transfer. These findings have important implications for the differentiation of effector γδ T cells and their manipulation in cancer immunotherapy.",2021,cancer
40210826,Association between red and processed meat consumption and colorectal cancer risk: a comprehensive meta-analysis of prospective studies.,"Increasing evidence suggests that red and processed meat consumption may elevate the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), yet the magnitude and consistency of this association remain debated. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the relationship between red and processed meat intake and the risk of CRC, colon cancer, and rectal cancer using the most comprehensive set of prospective studies to date. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Google Scholar databases from 1990 to November 2024, to identify relevant prospective studies examining red, processed, and total meat consumption in relation to colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer risk. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted for each study and pooled using a random-effects model to account for variability among studies. Statistical evaluation was executed using the online platform MetaAnalysisOnline.com. A total of 60 prospective studies were included. Red meat consumption was associated with a significantly increased risk of colon cancer (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.15-1.30), colorectal cancer (HR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.10-1.21), and rectal cancer (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.39). Processed meat consumption showed similar associations with increased risk for colon cancer (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.07-1.20), colorectal cancer (HR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.14-1.28), and rectal cancer (HR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.30). Total meat consumption also correlated with an elevated risk of colon cancer (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.11-1.35), colorectal cancer (HR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.12-1.22), and rectal cancer (HR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.10-1.48). This meta-analysis provides robust evidence that high consumption of red and processed meats is significantly associated with an increased risk of colorectal, colon, and rectal cancers. These findings reinforce current dietary recommendations advocating for the limitation of red and processed meat intake as part of cancer prevention strategies.",2025,cancer
33909988,Energy status dictates PD-L1 protein abundance and anti-tumor immunity to enable checkpoint blockade.,"Aberrant energy status contributes to multiple metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that ketogenic-diet-induced changes in energy status enhance the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy by decreasing PD-L1 protein levels and increasing expression of type-I interferon (IFN) and antigen presentation genes. Mechanistically, energy deprivation activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn, phosphorylates PD-L1 on Ser283, thereby disrupting its interaction with CMTM4 and subsequently triggering PD-L1 degradation. In addition, AMPK phosphorylates EZH2, which disrupts PRC2 function, leading to enhanced IFNs and antigen presentation gene expression. Through these mechanisms, AMPK agonists or ketogenic diets enhance the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy and improve the overall survival rate in syngeneic mouse tumor models. Our findings reveal a pivotal role for AMPK in regulating the immune response to immune-checkpoint blockade and advocate for combining ketogenic diets or AMPK agonists with anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy to combat cancer.",2021,cancer
37621241,[Obesity and Colorectal Cancer].,"The prevalence of obesity has increased significantly worldwide, and this trend is likely to continue in the coming years. There is substantial evidence that obesity plays a crucial role in the development of colorectal cancer. Epidemiological data have consistently demonstrated a correlation between obesity and colorectal cancer. Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, chronic inflammation, altered levels of growth factors, adipocytokines, and various hormones are plausible biological mechanisms. In addition, obesity has been shown to have an impact on recurrence, treatment success, and overall survival. There are some reports, although the evidence is not conclusive, that weight loss and lifestyle changes such as dietary modification and physical activity can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. The understanding that obesity is a potentially modifiable risk factor that can affect the incidence and prognosis of colorectal cancer is crucial knowledge that can have an impact on the prevention and treatment of the condition.",2023,cancer
39334498,Gut microbiota drives colon cancer risk associated with diet: a comparative analysis of meat-based and pesco-vegetarian diets.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk is strongly affected by dietary habits with red and processed meat increasing risk, and foods rich in dietary fibres considered protective. Dietary habits also shape gut microbiota, but the role of the combination between diet, the gut microbiota, and the metabolite profile on CRC risk is still missing an unequivocal characterisation. To investigate how gut microbiota affects diet-associated CRC risk, we fed Apc-mutated PIRC rats and azoxymethane (AOM)-induced rats the following diets: a high-risk red/processed meat-based diet (MBD), a normalised risk diet (MBD with α-tocopherol, MBDT), a low-risk pesco-vegetarian diet (PVD), and control diet. We then conducted faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from PIRC rats to germ-free rats treated with AOM and fed a standard diet for 3 months. We analysed multiple tumour markers and assessed the variations in the faecal microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing together with targeted- and untargeted-metabolomics analyses. In both animal models, the PVD group exhibited significantly lower colon tumorigenesis than the MBD ones, consistent with various CRC biomarkers. Faecal microbiota and its metabolites also revealed significant diet-dependent profiles. Intriguingly, when faeces from PIRC rats fed these diets were transplanted into germ-free rats, those transplanted with MBD faeces developed a higher number of preneoplastic lesions together with distinctive diet-related bacterial and metabolic profiles. PVD determines a selection of nine taxonomic markers mainly belonging to Lachnospiraceae and Prevotellaceae families exclusively associated with at least two different animal models, and within these, four taxonomic markers were shared across all the three animal models. An inverse correlation between nonconjugated bile acids and bacterial genera mainly belonging to the Lachnospiraceae and Prevotellaceae families (representative of the PVD group) was present, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for the protective effect of these genera against CRC. These results highlight the protective effects of PVD while reaffirming the carcinogenic properties of MBD diets. In germ-free rats, FMT induced changes reminiscent of dietary effects, including heightened preneoplastic lesions in MBD rats and the transmission of specific diet-related bacterial and metabolic profiles. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that diet-associated cancer risk can be transferred with faeces, establishing gut microbiota as a determinant of diet-associated CRC risk. Therefore, this study marks the pioneering demonstration of faecal transfer as a means of conveying diet-related cancer risk, firmly establishing the gut microbiota as a pivotal factor in diet-associated CRC susceptibility.

Alcohol (relative risk per 20 g/day=1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.09-1.20) and calcium (per 300 mg/day=0.83, 0.77-0.89) intakes had the strongest associations, followed by six dairy-related factors associated with calcium. We showed a positive association with red and processed meat intake and weaker inverse associations with breakfast cereal, fruit, wholegrains, carbohydrates, fibre, total sugars, folate, and vitamin C. Genetically predicted milk consumption was inversely associated with risk of colorectal, colon, and rectal cancers.

25619144,Diet and colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common diagnosed cancer in men and the second in women. Dietary factors and lifestyle may contribute to the increasing CRC incidence, making these issues interesting for both the general population and the medical oncology community. The aim of this report is to present a review of the published epidemiologic research to date reflecting the most current scientific evidence related to diet and CRC risk. EMBASE and PubMed-NCBI were searched for relevant articles up to November 2014 that identified potential interactions between foods or dietary patterns and CRC risk. Obesity increases the risk of CRC by 19%. Regular physical activity reduces this risk by 24%. CRC risk derived from red meat intake is influenced by both total intake and its frequency. Fish consumption may decrease CRC risk by 12% whereas garlic intake is not significantly associated with reduced CRC risk. Intakes of more than 20g/day of fiber are associated with a 25% reduction of CRC risk and 525mL/day of milk reduces colon cancer risk by 26% in men. Moderate amounts of alcohol (25-30g/day) increase CRC risk. CRC is a preventable disease through the modification of associated risk factors, including physical inactivity, obesity and overweight, excessive meat intake, smoking and alcoholic beverage consumption. Nonetheless, epidemiological evidence in this regard is not conclusive so further research is warranted.",2015,cancer
34140290,Discovery and Features of an Alkylating Signature in Colorectal Cancer.,"Several risk factors have been established for colorectal cancer, yet their direct mutagenic effects in patients' tumors remain to be elucidated. Here, we leveraged whole-exome sequencing data from 900 colorectal cancer cases that had occurred in three U.S.-wide prospective studies with extensive dietary and lifestyle information. We found an alkylating signature that was previously undescribed in colorectal cancer and then showed the existence of a similar mutational process in normal colonic crypts. This alkylating signature is associated with high intakes of processed and unprocessed red meat prior to diagnosis. In addition, this signature was more abundant in the distal colorectum, predicted to target cancer driver mutations <i>KRAS</i> p.G12D, <i>KRAS</i> p.G13D, and <i>PIK3CA</i> p.E545K, and associated with poor survival. Together, these results link for the first time a colorectal mutational signature to a component of diet and further implicate the role of red meat in colorectal cancer initiation and progression. SIGNIFICANCE: Colorectal cancer has several lifestyle risk factors, but the underlying mutations for most have not been observed directly in tumors. Analysis of 900 colorectal cancers with whole-exome sequencing and epidemiologic annotations revealed an alkylating mutational signature that was associated with red meat consumption and distal tumor location, as well as predicted to target <i>KRAS</i> p.G12D/p.G13D.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2355</i>.",2021,cancer

The factors that may increase the risk of CRC include obesity and consumption of a high-fat diet, red meat, processed meat, and alcohol. Recently, the role of gut microbiota in the formation, progression and treatment of CRCs has been investigated in depth. An altered gut microbiota can drive carcinogenesis and cause the development of CRC. Studies have also shown the role of gut microbiota in the prevention of CRC and the impact of therapies involving gut microbiota on CRC.

32019626,Nutritional prevention of colorectal cancer.,"The preventability estimate for colorectal cancer (CRC) is approximately 50%, highlighting the huge potential for altering modifiable lifestyle factors (including diet and body fatness) in order to reduce risk of this common malignancy. There is strong evidence that dietary factors (including intake of wholegrains, fibre, red and processed meat and alcohol) affect CRC risk. The lack of positive intervention trials and limited mechanistic understanding likely explain limited public health impact of epidemiological observations, to date. An alternative strategy for nutritional prevention of CRC is use of supplements that provide higher individual nutrient exposure than obtained through the diet (chemoprevention). There are positive data for calcium and/or vitamin D and the n-3 fatty acid EPA from polyp prevention trials using colorectal adenoma as a CRC risk biomarker. Although CRC is an obesity-related malignancy, there remains a paucity of observational data supporting intentional weight loss for CRC risk reduction. Some types of obesity surgeries (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) might actually increase subsequent CRC risk due to alteration of local intestinal factors. There is intense interest in nutritional therapy of patients after diagnosis of CRC, in order to impact on recurrence and overall survival (now often termed cancer interception). In conclusion, nutritional prevention of CRC continues to hold much promise. Increased mechanistic understanding of the role of individual nutrients (linked to intestinal microbiota), as well as a precision medicine approach to CRC chemoprevention and interception based on both tumour and host factors, should enable translation of nutritional interventions into effective CRC risk reduction measures.",2021,cancer

Observational studies show associations between overweight/obesity and weight gain with several measures of reduced prognosis in women with breast cancer, and some suggestions of lower survival in women who are underweight or who experience unexplained weight loss after diagnosis. Observational studies have also shown an association between higher levels of physical activity and reduced breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality, although a dose-response relationship has not been established. The effects of purposive dietary weight loss and increase in physical activity on survival or recurrence in breast cancer are not yet established, and randomised controlled trials are needed for definitive data.

Most colorectal cancers arise from preexisting adenomatous or serrated polyps. The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer can be reduced with screening of average-risk adults 50 to 75 years of age. Randomized controlled trials show evidence of reduced colorectal cancer-specific mortality with guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests and flexible sigmoidoscopy. There are no randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of colonoscopy to reduce colorectal cancer-specific mortality; however, several randomized controlled trials comparing colonoscopy with other strategies are in progress. The best available evidence supporting colonoscopy is from prospective cohort studies that demonstrate decreased incidence of colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer-related mortality in individuals undergoing colonoscopy. Other screening options include fecal immunochemical testing, computed tomographic colonography, and multitargeted stool DNA testing combined with fecal immunochemical testing. There is good evidence that aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and hormone therapy decrease the risk of colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps, but potential harms limit their usefulness. There is good evidence that calcium supplementation, moderate dairy consumption, reduced red meat consumption, increased physical activity, decreased body mass index, and statin use decrease the risk of colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps. Although increased alcohol intake and tobacco use are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, there is no direct evidence that reducing alcohol consumption or smoking cessation decreases the risk.",2018,cancer
39202500,Obesity and Colorectal Cancer: A Narrative Review.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Cancer is a multicausal disease, and environmental, cultural, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and genetic factors can influence the risk of developing cancer. Colorectal cancer (CRC) stands as the third most common cancer globally. Some countries have observed a rise in the incidence of CRC, especially among young people. This increase is associated with lifestyle changes over the last few decades, including changes in diet patterns, a sedentary lifestyle, and obesity. Currently, obesity and overweight account for approximately 39% of the world's population and increase the risk of overall mortality of certain cancer types. This study aims to conduct a literature review examining the association between obesity and CRC. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This narrative review explored the pathophysiological mechanisms, treatment strategies, and challenges related to obesity and CRC. <i>Results</i>: Several studies have established a clear causal relationship between obesity and CRC, showing that individuals with morbid obesity are at a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. The adipose tissue, particularly the visceral, secretes proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein. Chronic inflammation is closely linked to cancer initiation and progression, with a complex interplay of molecular mechanisms underlying this association. Obesity can complicate the treatment of CRC due to several factors, reducing the therapeutic effectiveness and increasing the risk for adverse events during treatment. Dietary modification, calorie restriction, and other types of weight-control strategies can reduce the risk of CRC development and improve treatment outcomes. <i>Conclusions</i>: Obesity is intricately linked to CRC development and progression, making it a crucial target for intervention, whether through diet therapy, physical exercises, medical therapy, or bariatric surgery.",2024,cancer

Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence interval) for the highest (vs lowest) tertile of the Western diet score were 3.45 (1.53-7.78) (P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.001) for pks<sup>+</sup>E coli-high tumors, 1.22 (0.57-2.63) for pks<sup>+</sup>E coli-low tumors, and 1.10 (0.85-1.42) for pks<sup>+</sup>E coli-negative tumors. The pks<sup>+</sup>E coli level was associated with lower disease stage but not with tumor location, microsatellite instability, or BRAF, KRAS, or PIK3CA mutations. The Western-style diet is associated with a higher incidence of colorectal cancer containing abundant pks<sup>+</sup>E coli, supporting a potential link between diet, the intestinal microbiota, and colorectal carcinogenesis.",2022,cancer
27128451,"Red meat, diseases, and healthy alternatives: A critical review.","Meat is an important food for human nutrition, by especially providing high-quality protein and also some essential micronutrients, in front iron, zinc, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. However, a high intake of red and processed meat is associated with an increased risk for diseases, especially type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer, as several epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have shown. This review summarizes meta-analyses of publications studying the association between red and processed meat intake and type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, colorectal and other cancers, and all-cause mortality. Various potential mechanisms involved in the increased disease risk are discussed. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of healthy alternatives for meat, like fish, nuts, vegetables and fruits, pulses and legumes, whole grains, and dairy products are reviewed by including selected papers and recent meta-analyses.",2018,cancer
31233770,Lifestyle and dietary environmental factors in colorectal cancer susceptibility.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence changes with time and by variations in diet and lifestyle, as evidenced historically by migrant studies and recently by extensive epidemiologic evidence. The worldwide heterogeneity in CRC incidence is strongly suggestive of etiological involvement of environmental exposures, particularly lifestyle and diet. It is established that physical inactivity, obesity and some dietary factors (red/processed meats, alcohol) are positively associated with CRC, while healthy lifestyle habits show inverse associations. Mechanistic evidence shows that lifestyle and dietary components that contribute to energy excess are linked with increased CRC via metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, bacterial dysbiosis and breakdown of gut barrier integrity while the reverse is apparent for components associated with decreased risk. This chapter will review the available evidence on lifestyle and dietary factors in CRC etiology and their underlying mechanisms in CRC development. This short review will also touch upon available information on potential gene-environment interactions, molecular sub-types of CRC and anatomical sub-sites within the colorectum.",2019,cancer
33885236,Physical activity and cancer risk. Actual knowledge and possible biological mechanisms.,"Scientific evidence has shown that an increase in regular physical activity is associated with a decrease in the development of many types of cancer. Potential mechanisms that link physical activity to reduced cancer risk include a decrease in systemic inflammation, hyperinsulinemia, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), sex hormones, pro-inflammatory leptin and other obesity-related cytokines, and a significant increase in anti-inflammatory adiponectin levels. In addition, physical activity improves immune function and the composition and diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiota. Moderate physical activity is important for cancer protection, but the most significant changes in the inflammatory profile are conferred by physical activity performed at higher intensities. Thus, there is a need for further investigation into the type, intensity, and duration of physical activity for the prevention of some types of cancer and the development of effective recommendations. There is a strong evidence that physical activity of moderate to vigorous intensity protects against colon and breast cancer, and probably against cancer at all other sites.",2021,cancer
25475570,Diet and lifestyle in survivors of colorectal cancer.,"Much research supports the association between diet and lifestyle in the development of colorectal cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated an association between various energy balance host factors (obesity, physical inactivity, and certain dietary factors) and outcomes. This review summarizes the impact of modifiable lifestyle factors, including prediagnosis and postdiagnosis adiposity, physical activity, and diet, on the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer. The article focuses on associations of these factors in survivors of stage I to III colorectal cancer, and summarizes the possible mechanisms for the association between modifiable lifestyle factors and the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer.",2015,cancer
39396838,Microbiota and detrimental protein derived metabolites in colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cancer in incidence and the second leading cancer in mortality worldwide. There is growing scientific evidence to support the crucial role of the gut microbiota in the development of CRC. The gut microbiota is the complex community of microorganisms that inhabit the host gut in a symbiotic relationship. Diet plays a crucial role in modulating the risk of CRC, with a high intake of red and processed meat being a risk factor for the development of CRC. The production of metabolites derived from protein fermentation by the gut microbiota is considered a crucial element in the interaction between red and processed meat consumption and the development of CRC. This paper examines several metabolites derived from the bacterial fermentation of proteins associated with an increased risk of CRC. These metabolites include ammonia, polyamines, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), N-nitroso compounds (NOC), hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S), phenolic compounds (p-cresol) and indole compounds (indolimines). These compounds are depicted and reviewed for their association with CRC risk, possible mechanisms promoting carcinogenesis and their relationship with the gut microbiota. Additionally, this paper analyses the evidence related to the role of red and processed meat intake and CRC risk and the factors and pathways involved in bacterial proteolytic fermentation in the large intestine.",2024,cancer
30003539,Obesity surgery and risk of cancer.,"Obesity increases the risk of several types of cancer. Whether bariatric surgery influences the risk of obesity-related cancer is not clear. This study aimed to uncover the risk of hormone-related (breast, endometrial and prostate), colorectal and oesophageal cancers following obesity surgery. This national population-based cohort study used data from the Hospital Episode Statistics database in England collected between 1997 and 2012. Propensity matching on sex, age, co-morbidity and duration of follow-up was used to compare cancer risk among obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery (gastric bypass, gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy) and obese individuals not undergoing such surgery. Conditional logistic regression provided odds ratios (ORs) with 95 per cent confidence intervals. In the study period, from a cohort of 716 960 patients diagnosed with obesity, 8794 patients who underwent bariatric surgery were matched exactly with 8794 obese patients who did not have surgery. Compared with the no-surgery group, patients who had bariatric surgery exhibited a decreased risk of hormone-related cancers (OR 0·23, 95 per cent c.i. 0·18 to 0·30). This decrease was consistent for breast (OR 0·25, 0·19 to 0·33), endometrium (OR 0·21, 0·13 to 0·35) and prostate (OR 0·37, 0·17 to 0·76) cancer. Gastric bypass resulted in the largest risk reduction for hormone-related cancers (OR 0·16, 0·11 to 0·24). Gastric bypass, but not gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy, was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR 2·63, 1·17 to 5·95). Longer follow-up after bariatric surgery strengthened these diverging associations. Bariatric surgery is associated with decreased risk of hormone-related cancers, whereas gastric bypass might increase the risk of colorectal cancer.",2018,cancer
25918293,Role of physical activity and diet after colorectal cancer diagnosis.,"This review summarizes the evidence regarding physical activity and diet after colorectal cancer diagnosis in relation to quality of life, disease recurrence, and survival. There have been extensive reports on adiposity, inactivity, and certain diets, particularly those high in red and processed meats, and increased risk of colorectal cancer. Only in the past decade have data emerged on how such lifestyle factors are associated with outcomes in colorectal cancer survivors. Prospective observational studies have consistently reported that physical activity after colorectal cancer diagnosis reduces mortality. A meta-analysis estimated that each 15 metabolic equivalent task-hour per week increase in physical activity after colorectal cancer diagnosis was associated with a 38% lower risk of mortality. No randomized controlled trials have been completed to confirm that physical activity lowers risk of mortality among colorectal cancer survivors; however, trials have shown that physical activity, including structured exercise, is safe for colorectal cancer survivors (localized to metastatic stage, during and after treatment) and improves cardiorespiratory fitness and physical function. In addition, prospective observational studies have suggested that a Western dietary pattern, high carbohydrate intake, and consuming sugar-sweetened beverages after diagnosis may increase risk of colorectal cancer recurrence and mortality, but these data are limited to single analyses from one of two US cohorts. Additional data from prospective studies and randomized controlled trials are needed. Nonetheless, on the basis of the available evidence, it is reasonable to counsel colorectal cancer survivors to engage in regular physical activity and limit consumption of refined carbohydrates, red and processed meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages.",2015,cancer
31964201,Whole grain consumption and human health: an umbrella review of observational studies.,"Whole grains have been associated with a number of health benefits. We systematically reviewed existing meta-analyses of observational studies and evaluated the level of evidence for their putative effects based on pre-selected criteria. Of the 23 included studies, we found convincing evidence of an inverse association between whole grain consumption and risk of type-2 diabetes and colorectal cancer; possible evidence of decreased risk of colon cancer and cardiovascular mortality with increased whole grain intake, as well as increased risk of prostate cancer. Limited or insufficient evidence was available for all other outcomes investigated. Overall findings are encouraging for a positive effect of whole grain consumption on certain diseases, especially highly prevalent metabolic diseases, however, uncertainty of some negative associations deserves further attention.",2020,cancer
39289647,Genetically predicted dietary intake and risks of colorectal cancer: a Mendelian randomisation study.,"Effects of confounders on associations between diet and colorectal cancer (CRC) in observational studies can be minimized in Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. This study aimed to investigate observational and genetically predicted associations between dietary intake and CRC using one-sample MR. Using genetic data of over 93 million variants, we performed a genome-wide association study to find genomic risk loci associated with dietary intake in participants from the UK Biobank. Then we calculated genetic risk scores of diet-related variants and used them as instrumental variables in the two-stage least square MR framework to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations. We also performed observational analyses using age as a time-scale in Cox proportional hazard models. Allele scores were calculated from 399 genetic variants associated with the consumption of of red meat, processed meat, poultry, fish, milk, cheese, fruits, vegetables, coffee, tea, and alcohol in participants from the UK Biobank. In MR analysis, genetically predicted fruit intake was significantly associated with a 21% decreased risk of CRC (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.66-0.95), and there was a marginally inverse association between vegetable intake and CRC (HR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.71-1.02). However, null findings were observed in multivariable analysis, with HRs (95% CIs) of 0.99 (0.98-1.01) and 0.99 (0.98-1.00) per increment of daily servings of fruits and vegetables, respectively. Dietary habits were attributable to genetic variations, which can be used as instrumental variables in the MR framework. Our study supported a causal relationship between fruit intake and a decreased risk of CRC and suggested an effective strategy of consuming fruits in the primary prevention of CRC.",2024,cancer
33359264,Chemopreventive effects of anthocyanins on colorectal and breast cancer: A review.,"The present review has analyzed the scientific literature, available in the PubMed and Scopus databases, in order to summarize the current state of diet anthocyanin research in breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) animal models but also for up-to-date human studies. For CRC, 28 preclinical and 9 clinical studies were selected in line with our search query in science databases. In relation to BC, 14 preclinical and 5 clinical studies were selected. Remarkably, all the preclinical studies, to a greater or lesser degree, suggested a chemoprevention effect of anthocyanin in BC/CRC rodent models. These encouraging results from animal models are not extrapolated to the same degree to human studies where, from the similar theoretical daily doses of anthocyanins in these studies, the opposite results were reported. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the anthocyanin doses in the human studies carried out recently are low if we consider the estimated exposure to anthocyanins issued by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) or extremely low if we consider with caution the human equivalent dose based on body surface area from the preclinical dosage regimes used. Therefore, although some clinical data has demonstrated an inverse relation between anthocyanin consumption and BC/CRC, this could, in fact, be more relevant if we increase the daily human anthocyanin dose (as observed in animal model dose-effect studies) while new toxicological data for this flavonoid subtype are brought to light.",2022,cancer
37069719,Probiotics as a Therapeutic Approach in Colorectal Cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a growing concern worldwide. In recent decades, the incidence of CRC has increased, and this has been attributed to changes in lifestyle. The lack of physical activity, smoking habits, and a diet high in red meat and fat and low in fiber are important aspects of these deleterious changes in lifestyle. The increase in the incidence of CRC has impelled researchers to investigate methods for preventing and treating CRC with greater efficacy and fewer complications. Probiotics are an attractive and potentially promising therapeutic approach. They have been evaluated by a large number of preclinical and clinical studies in recent years, and it has been found that they can play a role in the prevention, treatment, and management of complications of CRC. This review provides a concise summary of the mechanisms of action of probiotics. Furthermore, it focuses on the results of clinical and preclinical studies that evaluated probiotics' effects on CRC management. It also discusses the effects of different strains of probiotics and their combination in CRC treatment.",2023,cancer
37612616,Association of meat consumption with the risk of gastrointestinal cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The association between gastrointestinal cancer and types of meat consumption, including red meat, processed meat, or a combination of both, remains disputable. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to estimate the association between meat consumption and gastrointestinal cancer risk. PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane library databases were searched systematically for eligible studies that investigated the relation between meat consumption and the risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers, including esophageal cancer (EC), gastric cancer (GC), colorectal cancer (CRC), colon cancer (CC), rectal cancer (RC), pancreatic cancer (PC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) throughout February, 2023. The pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was assigned as an effect estimate and calculated using a random-effects model with inverse variance weighting. Forty cohorts comprising 3,780,590 individuals were selected for the final quantitative analysis. The summary results indicated that a higher red meat consumption was associated with an increased risk of CRC (RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.02-1.16; P = 0.007) and CC (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.03-1.25; P = 0.011). Moreover, a higher processed meat consumption was associated with an increased risk of CRC (RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.13-1.26; P < 0.001), CC (RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.13-1.26; P < 0.001), and RC (RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.08-1.42; P = 0.002). Furthermore, a higher total consumption of red and processed meat was associated with an increased risk of CRC (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.06-1.20; P < 0.001), CC (RR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.04-1.33; P = 0.012), and RC (RR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.04-1.39; P = 0.016). Finally, the strength of higher consumption of total red and processed meat with the risk of GC, and higher consumption of red meat with the risk of RC in subgroup of high adjusted level was lower than subgroup of moderate adjusted level, while the strength of higher consumption of processed meat with the risk of RC and HCC in subgroup of follow-up ≥ 10.0 years was higher than subgroup of follow-up < 10.0 years. This study found that meat consumption was associated with an increased risk of CRC, CC, and RC, and dietary intervention could be considered an effective strategy in preventing CRC.",2023,cancer
39480162,Diet Changes and Colorectal Cancer Risk in the UK Biobank.,"Modifying dietary behaviors into healthier habits may attenuate the risk of colorectal cancer. This study aimed to investigate the association between dietary changes and the risk of colorectal cancer. Following dietary recommendations for red and processed meat, fruit and vegetables, and alcohol consumption, we classified 50,640 participants into poor and good adherence groups in the UK Biobank. Changes in dietary habits were defined as stable poor, poor to good, good to poor, and stable to good adherences. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the association between dietary changes and colorectal cancer risk. Women were more likely to follow dietary recommendations than men. After a median of 3.3 years from the latest follow-up, 8,328 (16.4%) participants followed an improved dietary habit and 5,808 (11.5%) participants had a worsened diet. Compared with men who stably consumed fruit and vegetables <5 servings/day, those who increased their consumption to ≥5 servings/day were related to colorectal cancer risk reduction [HR: 0.24 (0.09-0.63)]. However, the beneficial associations of increased fruit and vegetable consumption were not statistically significant in women [HR: 0.41 (0.11-1.56)]. Our findings support the evidence that increasing fruit and vegetable intake could serve as a beneficial strategy to mitigate colorectal cancer risk in men. Participants from the UK Biobank significantly changed their adherence to dietary recommendations during the follow-up. Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk among men.",2025,cancer
39172161,Diet and physical activity advice for colorectal cancer survivors: critical synthesis of public-facing guidance.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors report that diet and physical activity guidance from healthcare professionals following discharge from care is limited. Survivors seek advice from alternative sources. This study critically synthesised the English language diet and physical activity guidance available online for CRC survivors. We conducted an internet search to identify national cancer organisations (NCO) in countries with high CRC incidence rates. We searched NCO website content for guidance related to diet and physical activity. Recommendations were categorised by cancer phase (prevention/survivorship), cancer type, and the intended outcome (health or cancer-control-CRC recurrence/CRC-specific mortality). A synthesised guideline was derived from recommendations consistently made by at least half of the sources. We identified 12 NCOs from six countries, by whom 27 diet and physical activity recommendations were made. For CRC prevention, over 80% of recommendations were aimed at improving cancer-control outcomes. For CRC survivorship, less than 40% of recommendations were aimed at improving cancer-control outcomes. Physical activity was the only recommendation present on more than 50% of NCO websites aimed at improving cancer-control outcomes for CRC survivorship. Diet and physical activity guidance for CRC survivors on NCO websites is limited and primarily based on recommendations for improving general health, not improving cancer-control outcomes. NCO websites frequently refer survivors to primary prevention guidance, potentially reflecting the lack of evidence specific to CRC survivorship. There is a need for diet and physical activity advice for survivors that is evidence-based, comprehensive, and consistent across organisations and tailored to specific cancer sites.",2024,cancer
39658462,Diet and Physical Activity Behaviors of Breast Cancer Survivors: A Scoping Review.,"This scoping review explored insight into the current evidence on adherence to health behavior guidelines, specifically diet and physical activity among breast cancer survivors. A scoping review was conducted through databases including PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus with Full Text in November 2022, following the JBI methodology. The search strategy combined the keywords i) diet OR nutrition OR eating OR exercise OR physical activity OR fitness and ii) breast cancer survivors OR patients with breast cancer. Twelve original research studies were included; most were conducted in the United States (50%), followed by the European countries (33.34%). Most studies exclusively focused on physical activity (83.33%) and assessed adherence to the physical activity guidelines for Americans (30%), along with the American Cancer Society (20%) and American College of Sports Medicine (20%) guidelines. Overweight or obesity, comorbidity, race, and quality of life were reported as factors associated with physical activity. Independence of disease status was significantly associated with fruit and vegetable intake. Studies reported a wide range of prevalence of adherence to dietary and physical activity recommendations among breast cancer survivors. Further studies are needed to explore diet and physical activity in the context of factors affecting these behaviors among cancer survivors to support the development of healthy behavior, improve health outcomes, and reduce the disease burden among this population. Nurses have a key role in educating and coordinating multidiscipline teams to initiate and provide cancer survivorship care. These findings indicate that nurses should consider developing targeted strategies and education to promote dietary patterns and physical activity adherence among breast cancer survivors.",2025,cancer
28803384,Does obesity modify the relationship between physical activity and breast cancer risk?,"With only 5-10% of breast cancer cases attributed to genetic inheritance, prevention efforts have focused on modifiable risk factors. Physical activity plays a role in reducing breast cancer risk; however, the interaction between physical activity and other modifiable risk factors, such as obesity, has received little attention. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of studies examining the relationship between physical activity and breast cancer and how it may be modified by body mass index (BMI). A total of 29 papers were included: 18 were cohort and 11 were case-control studies. Overall, a significant reduction in the relative risk of breast cancer was found in postmenopausal women with high versus low levels of physical activity for women with a BMI <25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79, 0.92) and ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81, 0.93) but not ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (RR: 0.93, 95% CI 0.76, 1.13). Physical activity was not associated with a significant reduction in risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women in any BMI group. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that physical activity is associated with a larger breast cancer risk reduction among women who are normal weight or overweight than among women who are obese. Since the included studies used diverse methods for assessment of physical activity and categories of BMI, results should be interpreted with caution and additional work is needed.",2017,cancer
38451185,Diabetes Risk Reduction Diet and Colorectal Cancer Risk.,"Diabetes has been associated with colorectal cancer. We evaluated whether adherence to a diabetes risk reduction diet (DRRD) can favorably influence the risk of colorectal cancer. Data came from a multicentric Italian case-control study including 1,953 histologically confirmed colorectal cancer cases and 4,154 hospital controls admitted for acute nonneoplastic diseases. Diet was assessed through a validated and reproducible food frequency questionnaire. The DRRD score was computed assigning higher values for higher consumption of cereal fiber, fruit, coffee, nuts and a higher polyunsaturated/saturated fats ratio and for lower glycemic index and lower consumption of red/processed meat and sweetened beverages and fruit juices. The ORs and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of colorectal cancer according to the DRRD score were obtained using logistic regression models adjusting for total energy intake and other major confounders. The DRRD was inversely related to colorectal cancer risk. The ORs of colorectal cancer were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.67-0.89) for the third versus first score tertile (Ptrend < 0.001) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87-0.96) for a 3-point increment in the score. Inverse associations were observed for colon and rectal cancers and were consistent in strata of sex, age, and other major covariates. A higher adherence to a DRRD was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk. Given the high incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer, adherence to a DRRD can have relevant prevention and public health implications.",2024,cancer
36069337,Associations of red and processed meat intake with screen-detected colorectal lesions.,"Limited data exist regarding the role of meat consumption in early-stage colorectal carcinogenesis. We examined associations of red and processed meat intake with screen-detected colorectal lesions in immunochemical fecal occult blood test (FIT)-positive participants, enrolled in the Norwegian CRCbiome study during 2017-2021, aged 55-77 years. Absolute and energy-adjusted intakes of red and processed meat (combined and individually) were assessed using a validated, semi-quantitative FFQ. Associations between meat intake and screen-detected colorectal lesions were examined using multinomial logistic regression analyses with adjustment for key covariates. Of 1162 participants, 319 presented with advanced colorectal lesions at colonoscopy. High <i>v</i>. low energy-adjusted intakes of red and processed meat combined, as well as red meat alone, were borderline to significantly positively associated with advanced colorectal lesions (OR of 1·24 (95 % CI 0·98, 1·57) and 1·34 (95 % CI 1·07, 1·69), respectively). A significant dose-response relationship was also observed for absolute intake levels (OR of 1·32 (95 % CI 1·09, 1·60) per 100 g/d increase in red and processed meat). For processed meat, no association was observed between energy-adjusted intakes and advanced colorectal lesions. A significant positive association was, however, observed for participants with absolute intake levels ≥ 100 <i>v</i>. < 50 g/d (OR of 1·19 (95 % CI 1·09, 1·31)). In summary, high intakes of red and processed meat were associated with presence of advanced colorectal lesions at colonoscopy in FIT-positive participants. The study demonstrates a potential role of dietary data to improve the performance of FIT-based screening.",2023,cancer
38887915,Effects of exercise or metformin on myokine concentrations in patients with breast and colorectal cancer: A phase II multi-centre factorial randomized trial.,"Physical activity and metformin pharmacotherapy are associated with improved clinical outcomes in breast and colorectal cancer survivors. Myokines are cytokines secreted from skeletal muscle that may mediate these associations. This hypothesis-generating analysis used biospecimens collected from a multi-centre 2 × 2 factorial randomized design of 116 patients with stage I-III breast and colorectal cancer who were randomized to 12 weeks of (1) aerobic exercise (moderate intensity titrated to 220 min/week); (2) metformin (850 mg daily for 2 weeks and then titrated to 850 mg twice per day); (3) aerobic exercise and metformin; or (4) control. Fourteen myokines were quantified using a multiplex panel. Myokine concentrations were log-transformed, and main effects analyses were conducted using linear mixed-effects regression models. The type I error rate was controlled with the Holm sequential testing procedure. Randomization to exercise increased leukaemia inhibitory factor (1.26 pg/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69, 1.84; adjusted P = 0.001) and interleukin-15 (2.23 pg/mL, 95% CI: 0.87, 3.60; adjusted P = 0.013) compared with randomization to no exercise. Randomization to metformin decreased apelin (-2.69 pg/mL, 95% CI: -4.31, -1.07; adjusted P = 0.014) and interleukin-15 (-1.74 pg/mL, 95% CI: -2.79, -0.69; adjusted P = 0.013) compared with randomization to no metformin. Metformin decreased myostatin, irisin, oncostatin M, fibroblast growth factor 21 and osteocrin; however, these changes were not statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. This pilot study demonstrates that randomization to exercise and metformin elicit unique effects on myokine concentrations in cancer patients. This hypothesis-generating observation warrants further basic, translational and clinical investigation and replication.",2024,cancer
33392963,Incidence and Risk Factors of Colorectal Cancer in the Iranian Population: a Systematic Review.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate its incidence and risk factors in the Iranian population. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, SID, and Magiran from inception until 2019. Studies that reported the incidence rate and risk factors of colorectal cancer were included in this review. Twenty-one articles that reported the incidence rate and 13 that reported the risk factors were included. The incidence rate was different according to the population type, gender, age, and study year in different regions. The main risk factors for colorectal cancer were high consumption of red meat and fried food and low intake of fruits and vegetables, diabetes, a positive family history, and obesity. The incidence of CRC has a marked variation in different parts of Iran, and various risk factors are associated with colorectal cancer. According to incidence rate and various risk factors, precise planning is needed to control colorectal cancer in the future.",2021,cancer
33477496,Diet and <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala Polymorphism Interactions in Relation to Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review.,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2 gene Pro12Ala allele polymorphism (<i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala; rs1801282) has been linked to both cancer risk and dietary factors. We conducted the first systematic literature review of studies published before December 2020 using the PubMed database to summarize the current evidence on whether dietary factors for cancer may differ by individuals carrying C (common) and/or G (minor) alleles of the <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism. The inclusion criteria were observational studies that investigated the association between food or nutrient consumption and risk of incident cancer stratified by <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism. From 3815 identified abstracts, nine articles (18,268 participants and 4780 cancer cases) covering three cancer sites (i.e., colon/rectum, prostate, and breast) were included. CG/GG allele carriers were more impacted by dietary factors than CC allele carriers. High levels of protective factors (e.g., carotenoids and prudent dietary patterns) were associated with a lower cancer risk, and high levels of risk factors (e.g., alcohol and refined grains) were associated with a higher cancer risk. In contrast, both CG/GG and CC allele carriers were similarly impacted by dietary fats, well-known PPAR-γ agonists. These findings highlight the complex relation between <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism, dietary factors, and cancer risk, which warrant further investigation.",2021,cancer
25941850,Red Meat and Colorectal Cancer: A Quantitative Update on the State of the Epidemiologic Science.,"The potential relationship between red meat consumption and colorectal cancer (CRC) has been the subject of scientific debate. Given the high degree of resulting uncertainty, our objective was to update the state of the science by conducting a systematic quantitative assessment of the epidemiologic literature. Specifically, we updated and expanded our previous meta-analysis by integrating data from new prospective cohort studies and conducting a broader evaluation of the relative risk estimates by specific intake categories. Data from 27 independent prospective cohort studies were meta-analyzed using random-effects models, and sources of potential heterogeneity were examined through subgroup and sensitivity analyses. In addition, a comprehensive evaluation of potential dose-response patterns was conducted. In the meta-analysis of all cohorts, a weakly elevated summary relative risk was observed (1.11, 95% CI: 1.03-1.19); however, statistically significant heterogeneity was present. In general, summary associations were attenuated (closer to the null and less heterogeneous) in models that isolated fresh red meat (from processed meat), adjusted for more relevant factors, analyzed women only, and were conducted in countries outside of the United States. Furthermore, no clear patterns of dose-response were apparent. In conclusion, the state of the epidemiologic science on red meat consumption and CRC is best described in terms of weak associations, heterogeneity, an inability to disentangle effects from other dietary and lifestyle factors, lack of a clear dose-response effect, and weakening evidence over time. KEY TEACHING POINTS: •The role of red meat consumption in colorectal cancer risk has been widely contested among the scientific community.•In the current meta-analysis of red meat intake and colorectal cancer, we comprehensively examined associations by creating numerous sub-group stratifications, conducting extensive sensitivity analyses, and evaluating dose-response using several different methods.•Overall, all summary associations were weak in magnitude with no clear dose-response patterns.•Interpretation of findings from epidemiologic studies investigating diet and health outcomes involves numerous methodological considerations, such as accurately measuring food intake, dietary pattern differences across populations, food definitions, outcome classifications, bias and confounding, multicollinearity, biological mechanisms, genetic variation in metabolizing enzymes, and differences in analytical metrics and statistical testing parameters.",2015,cancer
37097623,"Prospective Analysis Reveals Associations between Carbohydrate Intakes, Genetic Predictors of Short-Chain Fatty Acid Synthesis, and Colorectal Cancer Risk.","Whole grain and fiber intakes may decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. The interplay between host genetic factors, colonization of specific bacteria, production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and intake of whole grains and fiber could alter the protective role of carbohydrates against colorectal cancer. Here, we assessed intakes of types and sources of carbohydrates in 114,217 UK Biobank participants with detailed dietary data (2-5 24-hour dietary assessments), and a host polygenic score (PGS) was applied to categorize participants as high or low for intraluminal microbial SCFA production, namely, butyrate and propionate. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the associations of carbohydrates and SCFA with colorectal cancer incidence. During a median follow-up of 9.4 years, 1,193 participants were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Risk was inversely associated with intakes of non-free sugar and whole grain fiber. Evidence of heterogeneity was observed by the butyrate PGS; consuming higher amounts of whole grain starch was only associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in those with predicted high SCFA production. Similarly, in additional analyses utilizing the larger UK Biobank cohort (N = 343,621) with less detailed dietary assessment, only individuals with a high genetically predicted butyrate production had a lower risk of colorectal cancer per 5 g/day intake of bread and cereal fiber. This study suggests that colorectal cancer risk varies by intake of carbohydrate types and sources, and the impact of whole grain intake may be modified by SCFA production. Prospective population-level analyses provide evidence supporting the importance of butyrate production in reduction of colorectal cancer risk by whole grain consumption.",2023,cancer

A variety of rodent models have been used to investigate these relationships; however, key differences in experimental approaches, as well as unique aspects of rodent physiology lead to variability in how these valuable models are implemented. We combine expertise in the development and implementation of preclinical models of obesity and breast cancer to disseminate effective practices for studies that integrate these fields. In this review, we share, based on our experience, key considerations for model selection, highlighting important technical nuances and tips for use of preclinical models in studies that integrate obesity with breast cancer risk and progression. We describe relevant mouse and rat paradigms, specifically highlighting differences in breast tumor subtypes, estrogen production, and strategies to manipulate hormone levels.

This syndrome is the most common hereditary cancer syndrome and is caused by pathogenic variants in the genes responsible for DNA mismatch repair. Although the relationship between colorectal cancer risk and diet is well established, little is known regarding the influence of diet and nutritional characteristics on LS's clinical evolution. There is some evidence suggesting that individuals living with LS should follow general guidelines for diet and alcohol restriction/moderation, so as to achieve and maintain a favorable weight status and overall health and quality of life. However, more research is needed, preferentially from clinical studies of a prospective nature with robust designs, to better inform diet and behavioral patterns targeting cancer prevention in LS.",2024,cancer
27709695,"Vegetarianism and breast, colorectal and prostate cancer risk: an overview and meta-analysis of cohort studies.","Vegetarian diets may be associated with certain benefits toward human health, although current evidence is scarce and contrasting. In the present study, a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies was performed with respect to the association between vegetarian diets and breast, colorectal and prostate cancer risk. Studies were systematically searched in Pubmed and EMBASE electronic databases. Eligible studies had a prospective design and compared vegetarian, semi- and pesco-vegetarian diets with a non-vegetarian diet. Random-effects models were applied to calculate relative risks (RRs) of cancer between diets. Statistical heterogeneity and publication bias were explored. A total of nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. Studies were conducted on six cohorts accounting for 686 629 individuals, and 3441, 4062 and 1935 cases of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer, respectively. None of the analyses showed a significant association of vegetarian diet and a lower risk of either breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer compared to a non-vegetarian diet. By contrast, a lower risk of colorectal cancer was associated with a semi-vegetarian diet (RR = 0.86, 95% confidence interval = 0.79-0.94; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub> = 0.82) and a pesco-vegetarian diet (RR = 0.67, 95% confidence interval = 0.53, 0.83; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub> = 0.46) compared to a non-vegetarian diet. The subgroup analysis by cancer localisation showed no differences in summary risk estimates between colon and rectal cancer. A summary of the existing evidence from cohort studies on vegetarian diets showed that complete exclusion of any source of protein from the diet is not associated with further benefits for human health.",2017,cancer
27107745,Meat: The balance between nutrition and health. A review.,"Fresh and processed meats provide high biological value proteins and important micronutrients. On the other hand, a working group of IARC recently classified processed meat as 'carcinogenic to humans' and red meat as 'probably carcinogenic to humans' for colorectal cancer, appealing to critically consider the future role of meat in a healthy diet. This manuscript first evaluates the contribution of meat consumption to the supply of important micronutrients in the human food chain, and the extent to which this can be improved by primary production strategies, and impacts on human health. Secondly, the IARC hazard analysis of the carcinogenicity of red and processed meat consumption is discussed, arguing that having more insight in the mechanisms of the association offers opportunities for mitigation. It is advocated that the benefits and risks associated with red and processed meat consumption should not necessarily cause dilemmas, if these meats are consumed in moderate amounts as part of balanced diets.",2016,cancer
33815289,Mechanistic Targets and Nutritionally Relevant Intervention Strategies to Break Obesity-Breast Cancer Links.,"The worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity has tripled since 1975. In the United States, the percentage of adults who are obese exceeds 42.5%. Individuals with obesity often display multiple metabolic perturbations, such as insulin resistance and persistent inflammation, which can suppress the immune system. These alterations in homeostatic mechanisms underlie the clinical parameters of metabolic syndrome, an established risk factor for many cancers, including breast cancer. Within the growth-promoting, proinflammatory milieu of the obese state, crosstalk between adipocytes, immune cells and breast epithelial cells occurs <i>via</i> obesity-associated hormones, angiogenic factors, cytokines, and other mediators that can enhance breast cancer risk and/or progression. This review synthesizes evidence on the biological mechanisms underlying obesity-breast cancer links, with emphasis on emerging mechanism-based interventions in the context of nutrition, using modifiable elements of diet alone or paired with physical activity, to reduce the burden of obesity on breast cancer.",2021,cancer
37913806,Cancer Screening Prevalence and Preference among Hospitalized Women With and Without Obesity.,"This study explored the prevalence of nonadherence and preferences for breast cancer (BRC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among hospitalized women with and without obesity who were cancer-free at baseline. In addition, the study evaluated risk factors associated with nonadherence among hospitalized women with obesity. A prospective interventional study evaluated nonadherence prevalence and preference for cancer screening among hospitalized women aged 50 to 75 years. The intervention consisted of one-to-one bedside education via handouts about cancer screening. In addition, multivariable logistic regression models assessed associations between sociodemographic and clinical comorbidity variables believed to influence screening adherence among hospitalized women. Six months after discharge from the hospital, study participants received a follow-up telephone survey to determine adherence to BRC/CRC screening guidelines. Of 510 enrolled women, 61% were obese (body mass index ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Women with and without obesity were equally nonadherent to BRC (34% vs 32%, <i>P =</i> 0.56) and CRC (26% vs 28%, <i>P =</i> 0.71) screening guidelines. Almost half of the study population preferred undergoing indicated BRC/CRC screening in the hospital regardless of obesity status. After adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors, not having a primary care physician (odds ratio [OR] 5.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.20-15.7) and nonadherence to CRC screening (OR 3.65, 95% CI 1.94-6.54) were associated with nonadherence to BRC screening among women with obesity. After similar adjustment, having an education less than high school level (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.21-5.39) and nonadherence to BRC screening (OR 3.64, 95% CI 1.97-6.75) were associated with nonadherence to CRC among women with obesity.

25849747,Consumption of Red/Processed Meat and Colorectal Carcinoma: Possible Mechanisms Underlying the Significant Association.,"Epidemiology and experimental studies provide an overwhelming support of the notion that diets high in red or processed meat accompany an elevated risk of developing pre-neoplastic colorectal adenoma and frank colorectal carcinoma (CRC). The underlying mechanisms are disputed; thus several hypotheses have been proposed. A large body of reports converges, however, on haem and nitrosyl haem as major contributors to the CRC development, presumably acting through various mechanisms. Apart from a potentially higher intestinal mutagenic load among consumers on a diet rich in red/processed meat, other mechanisms involving subtle interference with colorectal stem/progenitor cell survival or maturation are likewise at play. From an overarching perspective, suggested candidate mechanisms for red/processed meat-induced CRC appear as three partly overlapping tenets: (i) increased N-nitrosation/oxidative load leading to DNA adducts and lipid peroxidation in the intestinal epithelium, (ii) proliferative stimulation of the epithelium through haem or food-derived metabolites that either act directly or subsequent to conversion, and (iii) higher inflammatory response, which may trigger a wide cascade of pro-malignant processes. In this review, we summarize and discuss major findings of the area in the context of potentially pertinent mechanisms underlying the above-mentioned association between consumption of red/processed meat and increased risk of developing CRC.",2016,cancer
38398847,Associations of Diet with Health Outcomes in the UK Biobank: A Systematic Review.,"The UK Biobank is a cohort study that collects data on diet, lifestyle, biomarkers, and health to examine diet-disease associations. Based on the UK Biobank, we reviewed 36 studies on diet and three health conditions: type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer. Most studies used one-time dietary data instead of repeated 24 h recalls, which may lead to measurement errors and bias in estimating diet-disease associations. We also found that most studies focused on single food groups or macronutrients, while few studies adopted a dietary pattern approach. Several studies consistently showed that eating more red and processed meat led to a higher risk of lung and colorectal cancer. The results suggest that high adherence to ""healthy"" dietary patterns (consuming various food types, with at least three servings/day of whole grain, fruits, and vegetables, and meat and processed meat less than twice a week) slightly lowers the risk of T2DM, CVD, and colorectal cancer. Future research should use multi-omics data and machine learning models to account for the complexity and interactions of dietary components and their effects on disease risk.",2024,cancer

36793105,"Design of the Building Research in CRC prevention (BRIDGE-CRC) trial: a 6-month, parallel group Mediterranean diet and weight loss randomized controlled lifestyle intervention targeting the bile acid-gut microbiome axis to reduce colorectal cancer risk among African American/Black adults with obesity.","Among all racial/ethnic groups, people who identify as African American/Blacks have the second highest colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence in the USA. This disparity may exist because African American/Blacks, compared to other racial/ethnic groups, have a higher prevalence of risk factors for CRC, including obesity, low fiber consumption, and higher intakes of fat and animal protein. One unexplored, underlying mechanism of this relationship is the bile acid-gut microbiome axis. High saturated fat, low fiber diets, and obesity lead to increases in tumor promoting secondary bile acids. Diets high in fiber, such as a Mediterranean diet, and intentional weight loss may reduce CRC risk by modulating the bile acid-gut microbiome axis. The purpose of this study is to test the impact of a Mediterranean diet alone, weight loss alone, or both, compared to typical diet controls on the bile acid-gut microbiome axis and CRC risk factors among African American/Blacks with obesity. Because weight loss or a Mediterranean diet alone can reduce CRC risk, we hypothesize that weight loss plus a Mediterranean diet will reduce CRC risk the most. This randomized controlled lifestyle intervention will randomize 192 African American/Blacks with obesity, aged 45-75 years to one of four arms: Mediterranean diet, weight loss, weight loss plus Mediterranean diet, or typical diet controls, for 6 months (48 per arm). Data will be collected at baseline, mid-study, and study end. Primary outcomes include total circulating and fecal bile acids, taurine-conjugated bile acids, and deoxycholic acid. Secondary outcomes include body weight, body composition, dietary change, physical activity, metabolic risk, circulating cytokines, gut microbial community structure and composition, fecal short-chain fatty acids, and expression levels of genes from exfoliated intestinal cells linked to carcinogenesis. This study will be the first randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of a Mediterranean diet, weight loss, or both on bile acid metabolism, the gut microbiome, and intestinal epithelial genes associated with carcinogenesis. This approach to CRC risk reduction may be especially important among African American/Blacks given their higher risk factor profile and increased CRC incidence. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04753359 .

39447046,Narrative review of lifestyle interventions in breast cancer survivors: current evidence and future directions.,"In 8 females, 1 will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. Although medical advances have increased the likelihood of survival, up to 90% of females will gain weight during and after treatment increasing the risk of breast cancer recurrence and obesity-related comorbidities in survivorship. Behavioral lifestyle interventions focused on diet with or without physical activity can provide breast cancer survivors nonpharmacological options to decrease weight gain and cardiometabolic risk. A PubMed search was conducted to identify all behavioral lifestyle interventions focused on diet or diet combined with physical activity longer than 4 weeks of duration in breast cancer survivors that included body weight as an outcome. This review aims to summarize the effects on body weight, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk markers. The review shows there is high heterogeneity in type and duration of the intervention to affect weight and cardiometabolic risk in survivorship. Calorie restriction with and without physical activity appears to promote weight loss among breast cancer survivors. However, the effects on cardiometabolic factors are less clear. Future studies should be powered for body weight and cardiometabolic effects. Researchers should also consider interventions that (1) are less complex, (2) recruit a more racially and ethnically diverse sample, (3) integrate resistance training, (4) implement the intervention in closer proximity to diagnosis, (5) target weight management in this population before it occurs, and (6) analyze body composition in addition to body weight measurements.",2024,cancer
32198788,Intestinal microbiota and its association with colon cancer and red/processed meat consumption.,"The human colon harbors a high number of microorganisms that were reported to play a crucial role in colorectal carcinogenesis. In the recent decade, molecular detection and metabolomic techniques have expanded our knowledge on the role of specific microbial species in promoting tumorigenesis. In this study, we reviewed the association between microbial dysbiosis and colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Various microbial species and their association with colorectal tumorigenesis and red/processed meat consumption have been reviewed. The literature demonstrated a significant abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis in patients with adenoma or adenocarcinoma compared to healthy individuals. The mechanisms in which each organism was postulated to promote colon carcinogenesis were collated and summarized in this review. These include the microorganisms' ability to adhere to colon cells; modulate the inhibition of tumor suppressor genes, the activations of oncogenes, and genotoxicity; and activate downstream targets responsible for angiogenesis. The role of these microorganisms in conjugation with meat components including N-nitroso compounds, heterocyclic amines, and heme was also evident in multiple studies. The outcome of this review supports the role of red meat consumption in modulating CRC progression and the possibility of gut microbiome influencing the relationship between CRC and diet. The study also demonstrates that microbiota analysis could potentially complement existing screening methods when detecting colonic lesions.",2021,cancer
26895247,Association between Metabolic Syndrome and Cancer.,"Growing data show the association of metabolic syndrome (MetS) or its components with cancer development and cancer-related mortality. It is suggested that in MetS and cancer association, insulin resistance and insulin-like growth factor 1 system play a key role, especially adipokines secreted from visceral adipocytes, free fatty acids and aromatase activity contribute to this process. It is also reported that MetS has a link with colorectal, breast, endometrial, pancreas, primary liver and, although controversial, prostate cancer. Although every component of MetS is known to have an association with cancer development, it is still debated whether the effects of these components are additive or synergistic. On the other hand, in the association between MetS and cancer, the role of antidiabetic and antihypertensive treatments including thiazolidinedione, insulin, angiotensin receptor blockers is also suggested. The primary approach in MetS-cancer relation is to prevent risk factors. Life style changes including weight loss and a healthy diet are known to decrease cancer risk in normal population. It is postulated that an insulin-sensitizing agent, metformin, has cancer-preventing effects on diabetic patients. This review discusses the relationship between MetS and cancer from different aspects and examines this relationship in some of the cancers suggested to be linked with MetS.",2016,cancer

29789344,PGC-1α as a Biomarker of Physical Activity-Protective Effect on Colorectal Cancer.,"Colorectal cancer is a significant public health concern. As a multistage and multifactorial disease, environmental and genetic factors interact at each stage of the process, and an individual's lifestyle also plays a relevant role. We set out to review the scientific evidence to study the need to investigate the role of the <i>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α)</i> gene as a biomarker of the physical activity's (PA) effect on colorectal cancer. PA is a protective factor against colorectal cancer and usually increases the expression of <i>PGC-1α</i> This gene has pleiotropic roles and is the main regulator of mitochondrial functions. The development of colorectal cancer has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction; in addition, alterations in this organelle are associated with colorectal cancer risk factors, such as obesity, decreased muscle mass, and the aging process. These are affected by PA acting, among other aspects, on insulin sensitivity and oxygen reactive species/redox balance. Therefore, this gene demands special attention in the understanding of its operation in the consensual protective effect of PA in colorectal cancer. A significant amount of indirect evidence points to PGC-1α as a potential biomarker in the PA-protective effect on colorectal cancer. The article focuses on the possible involvement of <i>PGC-1α</i> in the protective role that physical activity has on colorectal cancer. This is an important topic both in relation to advances in prevention of the development of this widespread disease and in its therapeutic treatment. We hope to generate an initial hypothesis for future studies associated with physical activity-related mechanisms that may be involved in the development or prevention of colorectal cancer. <i>PGC-1α</i> is highlighted because it is the main regulator of mitochondrial functions. This organelle, on one hand, is positively stimulated by physical activity; on the other hand, its dysfunction or reduction increases the probability of developing colorectal cancer. Therefore, we consider the compilation of existing information about the possible ways to understand the mechanisms of this gene to be highly relevant. This study is based on evidence of PGC-1α and physical activity, on PGC-1α and colorectal cancer, on colorectal cancer and physical activity/inactivity, and the absence of studies that have sought to relate all of these variables. <i>Cancer Prev Res; 11(9); 523-34. ©2018 AACR</i>.",2018,cancer
35086089,Diet and Lifestyle Habits in Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer: A Pilot Case-Control Study.,"Early-onset colorectal cancer (eoCRC), defined as a colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients younger than 50 years old, shows an increasing incidence worldwide in the latest years. The role of exogenous factors associated with CRC has been largely overlooked in eoCRC. Here, we conducted a case-control study to evaluate the diet and the lifestyle habits in an Italian population of patients with eoCRC, compared to age-matched healthy controls (HCs). We enrolled 118 subjects (47 cases, 71 controls) in a third-level academic hospital. We analyzed epidemiological features (age, sex, body mass index), lifestyle behaviors (smoking habits, physical activity, type of diet, use of dietary supplements), and eating habits (semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire) in eoCRCs and HCs, covering the previous 5 years. In our cohort, positive family history of CRC was significantly associated with the development of eoCRC (p = 0.004). Fresh meat (p = 0.003), processed meat (p < 0.001), dairy products (p = 0.013), and smoking (p = 0.0001) were significantly associated with eoCRC compared to controls. Other variables did not differ significantly between the two groups. Fresh and processed meat, dairy products, and smoking could be considered significant risk factors for eoCRC, although further confirmation by international multicenter studies is desirable.

We developed a microsimulation model to estimate how reductions in processed meat and unprocessed red meat consumption could affect rates of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, and mortality in the US adult population. We used data from two versions of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, one conducted during 2015-16 and one conducted during 2017-18, to create a simulated US population. The starting cohort was restricted to respondents aged 18 years or older who were not pregnant and had 2 days of dietary-recall data. First, we used previously developed risk models to estimate the baseline disease risk of an individual. For type 2 diabetes we used a logistic-regression model and for cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer we used Cox proportional-hazard models. We then multiplied baseline risk by relative risk associated with individual processed meat and unprocessed red meat consumption. Prevented occurrences of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, and mortality were computed by taking the difference between the incidence in the baseline and intervention scenarios. All stages were repeated for ten iterations to correspond to a 10-year time span. Scenarios were reductions of 5%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 75%, and 100% in grams consumed of processed meat, unprocessed red meat, or both. Each scenario was repeated 50 times for uncertainty analysis. The total number of individual respondents included in the simulated population was 8665, representing 242 021 876 US adults. 4493 (51·9%) of 8665 individuals were female and 4172 (48·1%) were male; mean age was 49·54 years (SD 18·38). At baseline, weighted mean daily consumption of processed meat was 29·1 g, with a 30% reduction being 8·7 g per day, and of unprocessed red meat was 46·7 g, with a 30% reduction being 14·0 g per day. We estimated that a 30% reduction in processed meat intake alone could lead to 352 900 (95% uncertainty interval 345 500-359 900) fewer occurrences of type 2 diabetes, 92 500 (85 600-99 900) fewer occurrences of cardiovascular disease, 53 300 (51 400-55 000) fewer occurrences of colorectal cancer, and 16 700 (15 300-17 700) fewer all-cause deaths during the 10-year period. A 30% reduction in unprocessed red meat intake alone could lead to 732 600 (725 700-740 400) fewer occurrences of type 2 diabetes, 291 500 (283 900-298 800) fewer occurrences of cardiovascular disease, 32 200 (31 500-32 700) fewer occurrences of colorectal cancer, and 46 100 (45 300-47 200) fewer all-cause deaths during the 10-year period. A 30% reduction in both processed meat and unprocessed red meat intake could lead to 1 073 400 (1 060 100-1 084 700) fewer occurrences of type 2 diabetes, 382 400 (372 100-391 000) fewer occurrences of cardiovascular disease, 84 400 (82 100-86 200) fewer occurrences of colorectal cancer, and 62 200 (60 600-64 400) fewer all-cause deaths during the 10-year period.

33364203,Colon Carcinogenesis: The Interplay Between Diet and Gut Microbiota.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence increases yearly, and is three to four times higher in developed countries compared to developing countries. The well-known risk factors have been attributed to low physical activity, overweight, obesity, dietary consumption including excessive consumption of red processed meats, alcohol, and low dietary fiber content. There is growing evidence of the interplay between diet and gut microbiota in CRC carcinogenesis. Although there appears to be a direct causal role for gut microbes in the development of CRC in some animal models, the link between diet, gut microbes, and colonic carcinogenesis has been established largely as an association rather than as a cause-and-effect relationship. This is especially true for human studies. As essential dietary factors influence CRC risk, the role of proteins, carbohydrates, fat, and their end products are considered as part of the interplay between diet and gut microbiota. The underlying molecular mechanisms of colon carcinogenesis mediated by gut microbiota are also discussed. Human biological responses such as inflammation, oxidative stress, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage can all influence dysbiosis and consequently CRC carcinogenesis. Dysbiosis could add to CRC risk by shifting the effect of dietary components toward promoting a colonic neoplasm together with interacting with gut microbiota. It follows that dietary intervention and gut microbiota modulation may play a vital role in reducing CRC risk.",2020,cancer

We included 52,938 cancer-free participants in the final analysis. Incident cancers were identified through linkage with the health insurance system and death registries. Cox proportional hazard models were introduced to assess the associations of total daily physical activity with the incidence of 6 common types of cancer.

Associations of RPMI with CRC risk across PRS levels were assessed using logistic regression models and compared to effect estimates of PRS using “genetic risk equivalent” (GRE), a novel metric for effective risk communication. RPMI multiple times/week, 1 time/day, and >1 time/day was associated with 19% (95% CI 1% to 41%), 41% (18% to 70%), and 73% (30% to 132%) increased CRC risk, respectively, when compared to RPMI ≤ 1 time/week. Associations were independent of PRS levels (pinteraction = 0.97). The effect of RPMI > 1 time/day was equivalent to the effect of having 42 percentiles higher PRS level (GRE 42, 95% CI 20−65).

We searched the Embase, PubMed, and EBSCOhost databases, considering papers published between January 2000 and May 2017 in any language, using a combination of the following subject headings: ""colorectal cancer,"" ""colorectal carcinoma survivor,"" ""survivorship plan,"" ""survivorship care plan,"" ""survivorship program,"" ""lifestyle,"" ""activities,"" ""exercise,"" ""diet program,"" and ""nutrition."" A total of 14,036 articles were identified, with 35 satisfying the eligibility criteria for the systematic review. These articles were grouped by the study questions into physical activity and diet: 24 articles were included in the physical activity group and 11 in the diet group. The research showed that an effective survivorship program can significantly help CRC survivors maintain good health and quality of life for long periods. However, there is a lack of consensus and conclusive evidence regarding how the guidelines for such a program should be designed, in terms of both its form and content.",2019,cancer
27510186,Lifetime grain consumption and breast cancer risk.,"We evaluated individual grain-containing foods and whole and refined grain intake during adolescence, early adulthood, and premenopausal years in relation to breast cancer risk in the Nurses' Health Study II. Grain-containing food intakes were reported on a baseline dietary questionnaire (1991) and every 4 years thereafter. Among 90,516 premenopausal women aged 27-44 years, we prospectively identified 3235 invasive breast cancer cases during follow-up to 2013. 44,263 women reported their diet during high school, and from 1998 to 2013, 1347 breast cancer cases were identified among these women. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) of breast cancer for individual, whole and refined grain foods. After adjusting for known breast cancer risk factors, adult intake of whole grain foods was associated with lower premenopausal breast cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quintile: RR 0.82; 95 % CI 0.70-0.97; P trend = 0.03), but not postmenopausal breast cancer. This association was no longer significant after further adjustment for fiber intake. The average of adolescent and early adulthood whole grain food intake was suggestively associated with lower premenopausal breast cancer risk (highest vs lowest quintile: RR 0.74; 95 % CI 0.56-0.99; P trend = 0.09). Total refined grain food intake was not associated with risk of breast cancer. Most individual grain-containing foods were not associated with breast cancer risk. The exceptions were adult brown rice which was associated with lower risk of overall and premenopausal breast cancer (for each 2 servings/week: RR 0.94; 95 % CI 0.89-0.99 and RR 0.91; 95 % CI 0.85-0.99, respectively) and adult white bread intake which was associated with increased overall breast cancer risk (for each 2 servings/week: RR 1.02; 95 % CI 1.01-1.04), as well as breast cancer before and after menopause. Further, pasta intake was inversely associated with overall breast cancer risk. Our results suggest that high whole grain food intake may be associated with lower breast cancer risk before menopause. Fiber in whole grain foods may mediate the association with whole grains.",2016,cancer
30032224,Dietary Inflammatory Index and Site-Specific Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response  Meta-Analysis.,"Existing evidence suggests a link between the inflammatory potential of diet and risk of cancer. This study aimed to test the linear and potential nonlinear dose-response associations of the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), as being representative of inflammatory features of the diet, and site-specific cancer risk. A systematic search was conducted with the use of PubMed and Scopus from 2014 to November 2017. Prospective cohort or case-control studies reporting the risk estimates of any cancer type for ≥3 categories of the DII were selected. Studies that reported the association between continuous DII score and cancer risk were also included. Pooled RRs were calculated by using a random-effects model. Eleven prospective cohort studies (total n = 1,187,474) with 28,614 incident cases and 29 case-control studies with 19,718 cases and 33,229 controls were identified. The pooled RRs for a 1-unit increment in the DII were as follows: colorectal cancer, 1.06 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.08; I2 = 72.5%; n = 9); breast cancer, 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.07; I2 = 84.0%; n = 7); prostate cancer, 1.06 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.15; I2 = 56.2%; n = 6); pancreatic cancer, 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.28; I2 = 61.6%; n = 2); ovarian cancer, 1.08 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.13; I2 = 0%; n = 2); esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 1.24 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.38; I2 = 64.3%; n = 2); renal cell carcinoma, 1.08 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.13; I2 = 0%; n = 2); and esophageal adenocarcinoma, 1.26 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.39; I2 = 0%; n = 2). A nonlinear dose-response meta-analysis showed that, after a somewhat unchanged risk within initial scores of the DII, the risk of colorectal cancer increased linearly with increasing DII score. In the analyses of breast and prostate cancers, the risk increased with a very slight trend with increasing DII score. In conclusion, the results showed that dietary habits with high inflammatory features might increase the risk of site-specific cancers.",2018,cancer
29713943,"The association of diet, gut microbiota and colorectal cancer: what we eat may imply what we get.","Despite the success of colonoscopy screening and recent advances in cancer treatment, colorectal cancer (CRC) still remains one of the most commonly diagnosed and deadly cancers, with a significantly increased incidence in developing countries where people are adapting to Western lifestyle. Diet has an important impact on risk of CRC. Multiple epidemiological studies have suggested that excessive animal protein and fat intake, especially red meat and processed meat, could increase the risk of developing CRC while fiber could protect against colorectal tumorigenesis. Mechanisms have been investigated by animal studies. Diet could re-shape the community structure of gut microbiota and influence its function by modulating the production of metabolites. Butyrate, one of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which act as a favorable source for colonocytes, could protect colonic epithelial cells from tumorigenesis via anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic properties through cell metabolism, microbiota homeostasis, antiproliferative, immunomodulatory and genetic/epigenetic regulation ways. In contrast, protein fermentation and bile acid deconjugation, which cause damage to colonic cells through proinflammatory and proneoplastic ways, lead to increased risk of developing CRC. In conclusion, a balanced diet with an increased abundance of fiber should be adopted to reduce the risk and prevent CRC.",2018,cancer
37111185,Sulfur Metabolism of the Gut Microbiome and Colorectal Cancer: The Threat to the Younger Generation.,"Colorectal cancer diagnosed in individuals under 50 years old is called early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), and its incidence has been rising worldwide. Simultaneously occurring with increasing obesity, this worrisome trend is partly explained by the strong influence of dietary elements, particularly fatty, meaty, and sugary food. An animal-based diet, the so-called Western diet, causes a shift in dominant microbiota and their metabolic activity, which may disrupt the homeostasis of hydrogen sulfide concentration. Bacterial sulfur metabolism is recognized as a critical mechanism of EOCRC pathogenesis. This review evaluates the pathophysiology of how a diet-associated shift in gut microbiota, so-called the microbial sulfur diet, provokes injuries and inflammation to the colonic mucosa and contributes to the development of CRC.",2023,cancer
25220168,Adolescent meat intake and breast cancer risk.,"The breast is particularly vulnerable to carcinogenic influences during adolescence due to rapid proliferation of mammary cells and lack of terminal differentiation. We investigated consumption of adolescent red meat and other protein sources in relation to breast cancer risk in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. We followed prospectively 44,231 women aged 33-52 years who, in 1998, completed a detailed questionnaire about diet during adolescence. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. We documented 1132 breast cancer cases during 13-year follow-up. In multivariable Cox regression models with major breast cancer risk factors adjustment, greater consumption of total red meat in adolescence was significantly associated with higher premenopausal breast cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quintiles, RR, 1.43; 95%CI, 1.05-1.94; Ptrend  = 0.007), but not postmenopausal breast cancer. Adolescent intake of poultry was associated with lower risk of breast cancer overall (RR, 0.76; 95%CI, 0.60-0.97; for each serving/day). Adolescent intakes of iron, heme iron, fish, eggs, legumes and nuts were not associated with breast cancer. Replacement of one serving/day of total red meat with one serving of combination of poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts was associated with a 15% lower risk of breast cancer overall (RR, 0.85; 95%CI, 0.74-0.96) and a 23% lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer (RR, 0.77; 95%CI, 0.64-0.92). In conclusion, higher consumption of red meat during adolescence was associated with premenopausal breast cancer. Substituting other dietary protein sources for red meat in adolescent diet may decrease premenopausal breast cancer risk.",2015,cancer
33990094,Educational level and colorectal cancer risk: the mediating roles of lifestyle and dietary factors.,"The association between the educational level and colorectal cancer risk was controversial in developed countries and evidence was limited in Chinese population. This study aimed to investigate the association between the educational level and colorectal cancer risk in Guangdong Province, China. From July 2010 to April 2019, 2502 newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients and 2538 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited in this case-control study. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between the educational level and colorectal cancer risk. Path analysis was used to investigate whether behavioral risk factors potentially mediated the association between the educational level and colorectal cancer risk. Educational level was inversely associated with the colorectal cancer risk. People who graduated from the college or above had a lower risk of colorectal cancer than those from the primary school or below, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.42 [95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.34-0.52]. The total, direct and indirect effects of the educational level for the colorectal cancer risk were statistically significant in the path diagram. Path analysis showed that lower red and processed meat intake and higher tea and coffee drinking among high educational participants contributed to the inverse association between the educational level and colorectal cancer risk. The findings suggested that the educational level was inversely associated with the colorectal cancer risk. The association might be mediated by red and processed meat intake, household and leisure-time activities, and tea and coffee drinking.",2022,cancer
34875940,Diet and Genetic Risk Factors of Colorectal Cancer in Palestine: A Case-Control Study.,"To add evidence to the limited data available on colorectal cancer (CRC) from Palestine, we examine the risk factors associated with CRC using a matched hospital-based case-control study. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 105 cases and 105 controls. A multivariable conditional regression model was used to adjust for the association between study factors and CRC risk. In the model, compared with controls, cases from villages were significantly less likely to have CRC (Adjusted Odds Ratio, AOR = 0.194); taking aspirin lowered the likelihood of CRC by 24%; and having a multiple birth sibling by 33%. Also, the likelihood of CRC was lowered significantly by consuming five servings of fruits/vegetables per week or more (5-6 servings: AOR = 0.21, 7-8 servings per week: AOR = 0.04). However, cases had a significantly higher likelihood of CRC if they consumed 2-4 servings of grilled red meat per week (AOR = 4.25); smoked (AOR = 4.38); had a sedentary lifestyle (AOR = 2.53); reported parental consanguinity (AOR = 3.88); or had a family history of cancer (AOR = 6.39). Our results confirmed the association between CRC and red meat intake and smoking, and proved that parental consanguinity and family history of cancer are also risk factors for CRC.",2022,cancer
32029911,Processed meat intake and incidence of colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies.,"The objective was to use accumulated evidence to explore the association between processed meat intake and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and to investigate the reliability of associations by evaluating patterns of risk by study population characteristics and research quality parameters. We included 29 observational prospective cohort studies with relative risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals for CRC according to various levels of processed meat consumption. Risk of bias was assessed using Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. Data sources were PubMed and Embase up to January 2017. The summary relative risks for high versus low processed meat consumption and risk of CRC, colon, and rectal cancer were 1.13 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.26), 1.19 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.31), and 1.21 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.49), respectively. Similar estimates were observed for the dose-response analyses. Heterogeneity across studies was detected in most analytical models. The overall judgment showed that two out of 29 studies had a moderate risk of bias, 25 had a serious risk of bias, and 2 had a critical risk of bias. The bias domains most often rated critical were bias due to risk of confounding, bias due to missing data, and selective outcome reporting bias. Although this meta-analysis indicates a modest association between processed meat intake and an increased risk of CRC, our assessment of internal validity warrants a cautious interpretation of these results, as most of the included studies were judged to have serious or critical risks of bias.",2020,cancer
40194340,"Burden of colorectal cancer attributable to high body-mass index in 204 countries and territories, 1990-2021: Results from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","A strong association between high Body Mass Index (BMI) and Colorectal Cancer (CRC) has been well established. However, the global burden of CRC attributable to high BMI remains underexplored. This study aims to examine and analyze the burden of CRC linked to high BMI at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2021. A descriptive analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021. Data on the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), as well as age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR), were extracted from the GBD 2021. Average annual percentage change (AAPC) was calculated to evaluate the temporal change in ASDR and ASMR using Joinpoint regression analysis. The Population Attributable Fractions (PAF) were used to analyze the CRC burden attributed to risk factors. In 2021, the global deaths and DALYs of CRC attributed to high BMI were 99,270 deaths and 2,364,660 years respectively, more than double the figures from 1990. High SDI regions bore the greatest burden while low-middle and middle SDI regions experienced a faster rise, with individuals over 60 and males being the most affected. East Asia, particularly China, had the heaviest burden globally. ASMR and ASDR were correlated with SDI. The top five risk factors for CRC burden were a diet low in whole grains (17.72 %), a diet low in milk (15.10 %), a diet high in red meat (14.55 %), high BMI (9.69 %) and a diet low in calcium (8.20 %) in 2021. High BMI is a significant risk factor for CRC, with aging, population growth, gender, and SDI contributing to geographic and temporal variations in the burden. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted prevention strategies, especially in high-risk populations, and emphasize the role of obesity prevention, early screening, lifestyle and dietary modifications, and interventions such as AI-driven technologies to reduce the CRC burden.",2025,cancer
27459444,Colorectal Cancer Epidemiology in the Nurses' Health Study.,"To review the contribution of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) to identifying risk and protective factors for colorectal adenomas and colorectal cancer (CRC). We performed a narrative review of the publications using the NHS between 1976 and 2016. Existing epidemiological studies using the NHS have reported that red and processed meat, alcohol, smoking, and obesity were associated with an increased risk of CRC, whereas folate, calcium, vitamin D, aspirin, and physical activity were associated with decreased risk of CRC. Moreover, modifiable factors, such as physical activity, vitamin D, folate, insulin and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, and diet quality, were identified to be associated with survival among CRC patients. In recent years, molecular pathological epidemiological studies have been actively conducted and have shown refined results by molecular subtypes of CRC. The NHS has provided new insights into colorectal adenomas, CRC etiology, and pathogenic mechanisms. With its unique strengths, the NHS should continue to contribute to the field of CRC epidemiology and play a major role in public health.",2016,cancer
31486137,Obesity and psychosocial well-being among cancer patients and survivors.,"As the association between obesity and cancer receives increasing attention, studies have begun to examine the potential impact of excess weight on psychosocial domains during treatment and survivorship. The current study will examine the effect of weight status on psychosocial outcomes among patients diagnosed with breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer. This retrospective study included 4159 patients over the age of 55 who were diagnosed with postmenopausal breast (52.2%), prostate (38.7%), or colon cancer (9.1%). Prior to treatment, patients were screened for problem-related distress using a 33-item touch screen-based instrument. Descriptive statistics were generated for each cancer type and one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) used to determine significant differences in distress by weight (nonobese: <30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs obese: ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ). A higher prevalence of biopsychosocial problem-related distress was reported by patients with breast cancer (M = 4.3) compared with prostate (M = 2.8) and colon cancer (M = 3.8). Obese breast and prostate cancer patients reported higher levels of problem-related distress compared with nonobese patients (P < .05), whereas an opposite trend was noted for patients with colon cancer. The current study found notable obesity-related differences among patients diagnosed with postmenopausal breast cancer or prostate cancer, with excess weight consistently associated with poorer psychosocial outcomes. These findings among a large cohort of patients provide insight into the impact of obesity during the cancer care trajectory and can provide guidance in the development and implementation of supportive care services for this ""at-risk"" population.",2019,cancer
40023392,Dietary intake of the red meat-derived glycan Neu5Gc fuels colorectal cancer through up-regulation of Wnt signaling pathway.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant health concern, often linked to western diets, particularly red meat consumption. Several mechanisms, such as the high heme iron content, the formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs), heterocyclic amines (HCAs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), have been suggested to explain red meat's cancer-promoting effects. However, these factors are also found in fish and poultry, which are not linked to CRC risk. A new hypothesis attributes red meat's impact on CRC to its high content of a nonhuman glycan. While most mammals express N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), humans express only Neu5Ac due to the loss of the CMAH enzyme. A red meat-rich diet leads to the incorporation of Neu5Gc into human cells, triggering an antibody-mediated inflammatory process known as xenosialitis. This study shows that Neu5Gc incorporation into CRC cells activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation. In a murine model lacking CMAH, a Neu5Gc-enriched diet induced intestinal polyp growth, with more malignant characteristics. Additionally, Neu5Gc incorporation in intestinal cells increased the expression of genes downstream of Wnt signaling. These findings reveal, for the first time in an in vivo model, a mechanism independent of immune response, where red meat consumption accelerates tumor progression through Neu5Gc incorporation. This activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway provides new insight into how red meat consumption may influence CRC progression.",2025,cancer
36254717,Developing a Diet and Physical Activity Intervention for Hispanic/Latina Breast Cancer Survivors.,"There is limited guidance on how to effectively educate cancer survivors to adopt and maintain specific diet and physical activity recommendations, especially among underserved and under-resourced populations. Here, the objective is to present the development of a behavioral and theoretically-based multi-modal diet and physical activity intervention program for Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors, <i>Mi Vida Saludable</i> (My Healthy Life). The development process was based on the 6 steps of the Nutrition Education DESIGN Procedure: (1). <b>D</b>ecide behaviors; (2). <b>E</b>xplore determinants; (3). <b>S</b>elect theory-based model; (4). <b>I</b>ndicate objectives; (5). <b>G</b>enerate plans; and (6). <b>N</b>ail down evaluation.

39207359,"Exploring the Relationship Between Diet, Lifestyle and Gut Microbiome in Colorectal Cancer Development: A Recent Update.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite advances in treatment modalities, its prevalence continues to rise, notably among younger populations. Unhealthy dietary habits, sedentary routines, and obesity have been identified as one of the key contributors to the development of colorectal cancer, apart from genetic and epigenetic modifications. Recognizing the profound impact of diet and lifestyle on the intricate gut microbiota ecosystem offers a promising avenue for understanding CRC development and its treatment. Gut dysbiosis, characterized by imbalances favoring harmful microbes over beneficial ones, has emerged as a defining feature of CRC. Changes in diet and lifestyle can profoundly alter the composition of gut microbes and the metabolites they produce, potentially contributing to CRC onset. Focusing on recent evidence, this review discussed various dietary factors, such as high consumption of red and processed meats and low fiber intake, and lifestyle factors, including obesity, lack of physical activity, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption, that influence the gut microbiome composition and elevate CRC risk.",2024,cancer
25975275,Mechanisms Linking Colorectal Cancer to the Consumption of (Processed) Red Meat: A Review.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. The vast majority of CRC cases have been linked to environmental causes rather than to heritable genetic changes. Over the last decades, epidemiological evidence linking the consumption of red and, more convincingly, of processed red meat to CRC has accumulated. In parallel, hypotheses on carcinogenic mechanisms underlying an association between CRC and the intake of red and processed red meat have been proposed and investigated in biological studies. The hypotheses that have received most attention until now include (1) the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic amines, two groups of compounds recognized as carcinogenic, (2) the enhancing effect of (nitrosyl)heme on the formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds and lipid peroxidation. However, none of these hypotheses completely explains the link between red and processed red meat intake and the CRC risk. Consequently, scientists have proposed additional mechanisms or refined their hypotheses. This review first briefly summarizes the development of CRC followed by an in-depth overview and critical discussion of the different potential carcinogenic mechanisms underlying the increased CRC risk associated with the consumption of red and processed red meat.",2016,cancer
33544443,Disparities in colorectal cancer screening among breast and prostate cancer survivors.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is recommended as an integral part of cancer survivorship care. We compared the rates of CRC screening among breast and prostate cancer survivors by primary cancer type, patient, and geographic characteristics in a community-based health-care system with a mix of large and small metro urban areas. Data for this retrospective study were abstracted from medical records of a multi-specialty practice serving about 250,000 individuals in southern Maryland. Breast (N = 1056) and prostate (N = 891) cancer patients diagnosed prior to 2015 were followed up till June 2018. Screening colonoscopy within the last 10 years was considered to be guideline concordant. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the prevalence odds ratios of being concordant on CRC screening by age, gender, race, metro area type, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Overall 51% of survivors had undergone a screening colonoscopy. However, there was a difference in CRC screening rate between prostate (54%) and breast (44%) cancer survivors. Older age (≥65 years), being a breast cancer survivor compared to prostate cancer, and living in a large compared to small metropolitan area were associated with a lower probability of receiving CRC screening. Having hypertension was associated with higher likelihood of being current on colonoscopy screening guidelines among survivors; but diabetes and obesity were not associated with CRC screening. Low levels of CRC screening utilization were found among breast and prostate cancer survivors in a single center in Southern Maryland. Gender, comorbidities, and residential factors were associated with receipt of CRC screening.",2021,cancer
34274444,"Food security, obesity, and meat-derived carcinogen exposure in US adults.","Risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) is increased in adults with poor diet quality, low socioeconomic status, and increased body mass index (BMI). Cooked meats contain high contents of mutagenic compounds related to CRC risk. To explore differences in meat-based carcinogen exposure, a 99-item Qualtrics survey was issued to 1648 US adults. Average monthly serving size, degree of doneness, and cooking methods of meat products were obtained. The National Cancer Institute CHARRED database was used to quantify exposure to HCAs, PAHs, and Ames Predicted and Estimated mutagenicity. Questions from validated instruments assessed food security status (FSS) and demographic variables, while height and weight were self-reported to calculate BMI. Sex, FSS and obesity status (BMI > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were compared using two-sample t-tests and multivariate regression models to determine differences in meat intake and carcinogen exposure. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Eight hundred fifty-six valid responses (57.4% female and 81.8% white) were obtained. Non-obese males consumed more white meat and were exposed to greater amounts of 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline. Food insecure and obese females consumed more red meat and had higher exposure rates of several carcinogens. Pan-frying and BBQ were the primary sources of meat-derived carcinogens. Greater disparities in carcinogen exposure were observed in females regarding BMI and FSS. Public health messages to modify meat cooking methods may be most effective for CRC prevention.",2021,cancer
27029874,[Physical activity and cardiovascular health].,"It is well known that regular moderate physical activity, in the context of a healthy lifestyle, significantly reduces the likelihood of cardiovascular events, both in primary and secondary prevention. In addition, it is scientifically proven that exercise can reduce the incidence of diabetes, osteoporosis, depression, breast cancer and colon cancer. Despite this strong evidence, sedentary lifestyle remains a widespread habit in the western world. Even in Italy the adult population has a poor attitude to regular physical activity. It is therefore necessary, as continuously recommended by the World Health Organization, to motivate people to ""move"" since the transition from inactivity to regular light to moderate physical activity has a huge impact on health, resulting in significant savings of resources.

27057575,Breast and Colorectal Cancer Survival Disparities in Southeastern Wisconsin.,"Cancer health disparities by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography are a top public health priority. Breast and colorectal cancer, in particular, have been shown to exhibit significant disparities and contribute a large proportion of morbidity and mortality from cancer. In addition, breast and colorectal cancer offer targets for prevention and control, including nutrition, physical activity, screening, and effective treatments to prolong and enhance the quality of survival. However, despite the investment of significant time and resources over many years, breast and colorectal cancer disparities persist, and in some cases, may be growing. This paper examines breast and colorectal cancer survival disparities in an 8-county region in southeastern Wisconsin, including the City of Milwaukee. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine survival trends, and a new adaptation of adaptive spatial filtering--a disease mapping method--was used to examine spatial patterns of survival. Disparities by race and ethnicity are revealed, and spatial analyses identify specific areas within the study region that have lower than expected survival rates. Cancer control efforts in southeastern Wisconsin should focus on black/African American and Hispanic/Latina women to reduce breast cancer survival disparities, and black/African American populations to reduce colorectal cancer disparities. Evidence indicates that targeted interventions may be needed to serve populations in the Milwaukee and Kenosha metropolitan areas, as well as areas of Walworth, Ozaukee, and Waukesha counties.",2016,cancer
29860952,Clinical implications of low skeletal muscle mass in early-stage breast and colorectal cancer.,"Although obesity has now been widely accepted to be an important risk factor for cancer survival, the associations between BMI and cancer mortality have not been consistently linear. Although morbid obesity has clearly been associated with worse survival, some studies have suggested a U-shaped association with no adverse association with overweight or lower levels of obesity. This 'obesity paradox' may be due to the fact that BMI likely incompletely captures key measures of body composition, including distribution of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Fat and lean body mass can be measured using clinically acquired computed tomography scans. Many of the earlier studies focused on patients with metastatic cancer. However, skeletal muscle loss in the metastatic setting may reflect end-stage disease processes. Therefore, this article focuses on the clinical implication of low skeletal muscle mass in early-stage non-metastatic breast and colorectal cancer where measures of body composition have been shown to be strong predictors of disease-free survival and overall survival and also chemotherapy toxicity and operative risk.",2018,cancer
29689357,Red meat and colon cancer: A review of mechanistic evidence for heme in the context of risk assessment methodology.,"On October 26, 2015, IARC published a summary of their findings regarding the association of cancer with consumption of red meat or processed meat (IARC 2015; The Lancet Oncology 2015). The Working Group concluded that there is limited evidence in human beings for carcinogenicity from the consumption of red meat and inadequate evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of consumption of red meat. Nevertheless, the working group concluded that there is strong mechanistic evidence by which ingestion of red meat can be linked to human colorectal cancer and assigned red meat to Group 2A ""probably carcinogenic to humans"". The Working Group cited supporting mechanistic evidence for multiple meat components, including those formed from meat processing, such as N-nitroso compounds (NOC) and heterocyclic aromatic amines, and the endogenous compound, heme iron. The mechanism of action for each of these components is different and so it is critical to evaluate the evidence for each component separately. Consequently, this review critically examined studies that investigated mechanistic evidence associated with heme iron to assess the weight of the evidence associating exposure to red meat with colorectal cancer. The evidence from in vitro studies utilized conditions that are not necessarily relevant for a normal dietary intake and thus do not provide sufficient evidence that heme exposure from typical red meat consumption would increase the risk of colon cancer. Animal studies utilized models that tested promotion of preneoplastic conditions utilizing diets low in calcium, high in fat combined with exaggerations of heme exposure that in many instances represented intakes that were orders of magnitude above normal dietary consumption of red meat. Finally, clinical evidence suggests that the type of NOC found after ingestion of red meat in humans consists mainly of nitrosyl iron and nitrosothiols, products that have profoundly different chemistries from certain N-nitroso species which have been shown to be tumorigenic through the formation of DNA adducts. In conclusion, the methodologies employed in current studies of heme have not provided sufficient documentation that the mechanisms studied would contribute to an increased risk of promotion of preneoplasia or colon cancer at usual dietary intakes of red meat in the context of a normal diet.",2018,cancer
39537473,"Colorectal cancer in Ethiopia: Epidemiological trends, diagnostic and laboratory capacities, and challenges.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) refers to cancer that develops in the colon or rectum, parts of the large intestine. It ranks as the third most prevalent form of cancer globally. Colorectal cancer is responsible for the morbidity of millions and the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide although the incidence varies significantly depending on geographical location. In recent years, CRC has decreased in high-income countries due to technological advancements in diagnosis and treatment. However, there is an increased occurrence of CRC morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries. Colorectal cancer is becoming an emerging public health concern in Ethiopia. We noticed that the incidence rates have been lower compared to more developed countries, but recent years have seen a noticeable increase. This rise is attributed to factors such as changes in diet, lifestyle, and an aging population. Common risk factors include dietary shifts towards processed foods and red meat, physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, in Ethiopia, screening programs for CRC are not widespread, and limited access to diagnostic facilities, lack of public awareness, and insufficient healthcare infrastructure contribute to late-stage diagnoses or left without diagnosis. Treatment options, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, are available but not uniformly accessible across the country, posing challenges for timely and effective treatment. Addressing colorectal cancer in Ethiopia requires a comprehensive approach to enhance public awareness, improve screening and early detection, expand treatment facilities, and train healthcare professionals to provide effective care.",2025,cancer
27869663,Dietary Protein Sources and Incidence of Breast Cancer: A Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies.,"Protein is important to the human body, and different sources of protein may have different effects on the risk of breast cancer. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between different dietary protein sources and breast cancer risk. PubMed and several databases were searched until December 2015. Relevant articles were retrieved according to specific searching criteria. Forty-six prospective studies were included. The summary relative risk (RR) for highest versus lowest intake was 1.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.14, <i>I</i>² = 34.6%) for processed meat, 0.92 (95% CI 0.84-1.00, <i>I</i>² = 0%) for soy food, 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-1.00, <i>I</i>² = 40.1%) for skim milk, and 0.90 (95% CI 0.82-1.00, <i>I</i>² = 0%) for yogurt. Similar conclusions were obtained in dose-response association for each serving increase: total red meat (RR: 1.07; 95% CI 1.01-1.14, <i>I</i>² = 7.1%), fresh red meat (RR: 1.13; 95% CI 1.01-1.26, <i>I</i>² = 56.4%), processed meat (RR: 1.09; 95% CI 1.02-1.17, <i>I</i>² = 11.8%), soy food (RR: 0.91; 95% CI 0.84-1.00, <i>I</i>² = 0%), and skim milk (RR: 0.96; 95% CI 0.92-1.00, <i>I</i>² = 11.9%). There was a null association between poultry, fish, egg, nuts, total milk, and whole milk intake and breast cancer risk. Higher total red meat, fresh red meat, and processed meat intake may be risk factors for breast cancer, whereas higher soy food and skim milk intake may reduce the risk of breast cancer.",2016,cancer
35999486,The effect of obesity on adipose-derived stromal cells and adipose tissue and their impact on cancer.,"The significant increase in the incidence of obesity represents the next global health crisis. As a result, scientific research has focused on gaining deeper insights into obesity and adipose tissue biology. As a result of the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue, obesity results from hyperplasia and hypertrophy within the adipose tissue. The functional alterations in the adipose tissue are a confounding contributing factor to many diseases, including cancer. The increased incidence and aggressiveness of several cancers, including colorectal, postmenopausal breast, endometrial, prostate, esophageal, hematological, malignant melanoma, and renal carcinomas, result from obesity as a contributing factor. The increased morbidity and mortality of obesity-associated cancers are attributable to increased hormones, adipokines, and cytokines produced by the adipose tissue. The increased adipose tissue levels observed in obese patients result in more adipose stromal/stem cells (ASCs) distributed throughout the body. ASCs have been shown to impact cancer progression in vitro and in preclinical animal models. ASCs influence tumor biology via multiple mechanisms, including the increased recruitment of ASCs to the tumor site and increased production of cytokines and growth factors by ASCs and other cells within the tumor stroma. Emerging evidence indicates that obesity induces alterations in the biological properties of ASCs, subsequently leading to enhanced tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancer cells. As the focus of this review is the interaction and impact of ASCs on cancer, the presentation is limited to preclinical data generated on cancers in which there is a demonstrated role for ASCs, such as postmenopausal breast, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, multiple myeloma, osteosarcoma, cervical, bladder, and gastrointestinal cancers. Our group has investigated the interactions between obesity and breast cancer and the mechanisms that regulate ASCs and adipocytes in these different contexts through interactions between cancer cells, immune cells, and other cell types present in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are discussed. The reciprocal and circular feedback loop between obesity and ASCs and the mechanisms by which ASCs from obese patients alter the biology of cancer cells and enhance tumorigenesis will be discussed. At present, the evidence for ASCs directly influencing human tumor growth is somewhat limited, though recent clinical studies suggest there may be some link.",2022,cancer
30638072,Role of Heme Iron in the Association Between Red Meat Consumption and Colorectal Cancer.,"The growing incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the world seems to be related to the spread of Westernized lifestyles, particularly dietary habits. Several studies have found that high consumption of red meat-especially processed red meat, a mainstay of Western diets-is associated with an increased risk of developing CRC. One possible reason for the association are the adverse effects exerted by the heme iron contained in red meat, which has the potential to affect homeostasis and colonic epithelial cell renewal and to promote the formation of mutagenic and carcinogenic agents. A correlation has also emerged between CRC and alterations of the gut microbiota, since the micro-organisms found in the intestinal lumen seem to influence the activation of enterocyte genes involved in the initiation and progression of carcinogenesis. Dietary habits can therefore modify the gut microbiota, affecting gene activation and favoring the development of cancer cells. We review and discuss the most recent literature on the hypothesis that heme iron can exert adverse effects by altering the gut microbiota and colorectal epithelial cell homeostasis.",2018,cancer
32400201,Epidemiologic Burden of Red and Processed Meat Intake on Colorectal Cancer Mortality.,"A clear epidemiologic association has been reported between intake of red processed meat and colorectal cancer. Therefore, an electronic search was performed in Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) registry, using the keywords ""diet high in red meat"", ""diet high in processed meat"", ""colon and rectum cancer"" and ""death"". According to this search, red and processed meat intake accounts for 1.77% and 1.18% worldwide colorectal cancer mortality, respectively. The death risk attributable to consumption of red meat linearly increased during the past decade (<i>r</i> = 0.99; <i>p</i> < 0.001), whilst that of processed meat exhibited linear decline (<i>r</i>= -0.97; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The risk of colorectal cancer death for both types of meat is higher in men than in women. Colorectal cancer mortality for red meat is mostly clustered in people <75 years, whilst that attributable to processed meat increases with ageing. A positive relationship can be observed between consumption of both meats and socio-demographic index (SDI). The risk of colorectal cancer deaths attributable to red meat is independently associated with male sex, higher SDI and younger age, whilst that of processed meat is independently associated with higher SDI and older age. Reinforced efforts shall be prioritized for broadening recommendations on decreasing red and processed meat consumption.",2021,cancer
26028066,Obesity and Obese-related Chronic Low-grade Inflammation in Promotion of Colorectal Cancer Development.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a worldwide health problem, being the third most commonly detected cancer in males and the second in females. Rising CRC incidence trends are mainly regarded as a part of the rapid 'Westernization' of life-style and are associated with calorically excessive high-fat/low-fibre diet, consumption of refined products, lack of physical activity, and obesity. Most recent epidemiological and clinical investigations have consistently evidenced a significant relationship between obesity-driven inflammation in particular steps of colorectal cancer development, including initiation, promotion, progression, and metastasis. Inflammation in obesity occurs by several mechanisms. Roles of imbalanced metabolism (MetS), distinct immune cells, cytokines, and other immune mediators have been suggested in the inflammatory processes. Critical mechanisms are accounted to proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). These molecules are secreted by macrophages and are considered as major agents in the transition between acute and chronic inflammation and inflammation-related CRC. The second factor promoting the CRC development in obese individuals is altered adipokine concentrations (leptin and adiponectin). The role of leptin and adiponectin in cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis is attributable to the activation of several signal transduction pathways (JAK/STAT, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), mTOR, and 5'AMPK signaling pathways) and multiple dysregulation (COX-2 downregulation, mRNA expression).",2015,cancer
34951572,"Molecular Pathways, Targeted Therapies, and Proteomic Investigations of Colorectal Cancer.","According to the GLOBOCAN 2020 data, colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. The risk factors for colorectal cancer include a diet abundant with fat, refined carbohydrates, animal protein, low fiber content, alcoholism, obesity, long-term cigarette smoking, low physical activity, and aging. Colorectal carcinomas are classified as adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine, squamous cell, adenosquamous, spindle cell, and undifferentiated carcinomas. In addition, many variants of colorectal carcinomas have been recently distinguished based on histological, immunological, and molecular characteristics. Recently developed targeted molecules in conjunction with standard chemotherapeutics or immune checkpoint inhibitors provide promising treatment protocols for colorectal cancer. However, the benefit of targeted therapies is strictly dependent on the mutational status of signaling molecules (e.g., KRAS) or mismatch repair systems. Here it is aimed to provide a comprehensive view of colorectal cancer types, molecular pathways associated, recently developed targeted therapies, as well as proteomic investigations applied to colorectal cancer for the discovery of novel biomarkers and new targets for treatment protocols.",2023,cancer
30489355,"Red meat intake, CYP2E1 and PPARγ polymorphisms, and colorectal cancer risk.","The association between red meat intake and colorectal cancer (CRC) may be modulated by genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), a key enzyme in the metabolism of nitrosamines, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a transcription factor involved in adipogenesis and lipid and glucose metabolism. We conducted a case-control study of 971 patients with CRC and 658 controls who were admitted to two university hospitals between 1995 and 2004 in Seoul, Korea. Participants were asked about red meat intake by using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Polymorphisms of CYP2E1 (rs3813867) and PPARγ (rs1801282 or rs3856806) were identified using the TaqMan assay. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable logistic regression models. We found that the association between red meat and CRC varied by CYP2E1 polymorphisms; ORs (95% CIs) for at least five or more vs. less than one time/week of red meat intake were 2.77 (1.23-6.25) among individuals with C alleles of CYP2E1 and 0.89 (0.51-1.54) among individuals with the GG allele (Pinteraction=0.05). Compared with those individuals with the CC allele, increasing risk of CRC with increasing red meat intake was more pronounced among individuals with T alleles of PPARγC161T (rs3856806), but the association was not significant. Our data provide evidence that East Asians with the variant type of CYP2E1 may have high susceptibility to development of CRC risk.",2019,cancer
31615096,Potential Mechanisms of Probiotics Action in the Prevention and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer.,"Colorectal cancer is one of the most common and most diagnosed cancers in the world. There are many predisposing factors, for example, genetic predisposition, smoking, or a diet rich in red, processed meat and poor in vegetables and fruits. Probiotics may be helpful in the prevention of cancer and may provide support during treatment. The main aim of this study is to characterize the potential mechanisms of action of probiotics, in particular the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. Probiotics' potential mechanisms of action are, for example, modification of intestinal microbiota, improvement of colonic physicochemical conditions, production of anticancerogenic and antioxidant metabolites against carcinogenesis, a decrease in intestinal inflammation, and the production of harmful enzymes. The prevention of colorectal cancer is associated with favorable quantitative and qualitative changes in the intestinal microbiota, as well as changes in metabolic activity and in the physicochemical conditions of the intestine. In addition, it is worth noting that the effect depends on the bacterial strain, as well as on the dose administered.",2019,cancer
33989021,Harnessing Nutrition and Physical Activity for Breast Cancer Prevention and Control to Reduce Racial/Ethnic Cancer Health Disparities.,"There are well-known racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity, as well as breast cancer risk and survival. However, most of the current scientific evidence that serves as a foundation for nutrition and physical activity guidelines is based on studies conducted in predominantly non-Hispanic White populations. Similarly, exercise, diet, or lifestyle intervention trials for breast cancer prevention and survivorship are scarce in racial/ethnic minority populations. We review the current evidence for racial/ethnic disparities in obesity and breast cancer risk and survival (we are focusing on obesity, because this is considered an ASCO priority, and studies conducted in the United States), discuss the evolution of nutrition/physical activity guidelines for cancer prevention and control, and provide an overview of lifestyle interventions, including barriers and facilitators in implementation and dissemination science among minority populations underrepresented in research. There is a critical need to include racially/ethnically diverse populations in cancer prevention and control research or to specifically target minority populations in which disparities are known to exist to achieve much needed health equity.",2021,cancer
30183083,Consumption of red and processed meat and breast cancer incidence: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.,"Prior studies on red and processed meat consumption with breast cancer risk have generated inconsistent results. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to summarize the evidence regarding the relation of red meat and processed meat consumption with breast cancer incidence. We searched in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through January 2018 for prospective studies that reported the association between red meat and processed meat consumption with incident breast cancer. The multivariable-adjusted relative risk (RR) was combined comparing the highest with the lowest category of red meat (unprocessed) and processed meat consumption using a random-effect meta-analysis. We identified 13 cohort, 3 nested case-control and two clinical trial studies. Comparing the highest to the lowest category, red meat (unprocessed) consumption was associated with a 6% higher breast cancer risk (pooled RR,1.06; 95% confidence intervals (95%CI):0.99-1.14; I<sup>2</sup> = 56.3%), and processed meat consumption was associated with a 9% higher breast cancer risk (pooled RR, 1.09; 95%CI, 1.03-1.16; I<sup>2</sup> = 44.4%). In addition, we identified two nested case-control studies evaluating the association between red meat and breast cancer stratified by N-acetyltransferase 2 acetylator genotype. We did not observe any association among those with either fast (per 25 g/day pooled odds ratio (OR), 1.18; 95%CI, 0.93-1.50) or slow N-acetyltransferase 2 acetylators (per 25 g/day pooled OR, 0.99; 95%CI, 0.91-1.08).

39064692,"A Diet Lacking Selenium, but Not Zinc, Copper or Manganese, Induces Anticancer Activity in Mice with Metastatic Cancers.","Selenium, zinc, copper, and manganese are essential components of antioxidant enzymes involved in the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Given that cancer cells produce high levels of ROS and the accumulation of ROS can lead to cell death, cancer cells may be susceptible to strategies that reduce ROS elimination. In this work, we prepared several artificial diets that contained normal carbohydrate, protein, and lipid levels but lacked selenium, zinc, copper, or manganese. The anticancer activity of these diets was examined in a metastatic ovarian cancer model, established by injecting ID8 <i>Trp53</i><sup>-/-</sup> murine ovarian cancer cells into the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6JRj mice. Treatments started 15 days later and consisted of replacing a normal diet with one of the artificial diets for several weeks. A significant improvement in mice survival was observed when the normal diet was replaced with the selenium-free diet. Diets lacking zinc, copper, or manganese showed no significant impact on mice survival. All diets were very well tolerated. The anticancer efficacy of a diet lacking selenium was confirmed in mice with metastatic colon cancer and in mice with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. These results suggest that diets lacking selenium hold potential for the treatment of metastatic cancers.",2024,cancer
28450127,Carcinogenicity of consumption of red meat and processed meat: A review of scientific news since the IARC decision.,"In October 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) issued a press release on the results of the evaluation of the carcinogenicity of red and processed meat. Based on the accumulated scientific literature, the consumption of red meat was classified as ""probably carcinogenic to humans"" and processed meat as ""carcinogenic to humans"". Given the importance of this topic, this review was aimed at revising the current state-of-the-art on the carcinogenicity of red and processed meat, some time after the IARC decision. Some new epidemiological studies and new reviews clearly supporting the IARC decision have been published during these months. However, a number of gaps still exist. It is basic to establish the mechanisms leading to the increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and other cancers arising from red and processed meat consumption. Another important pending issue is to establish the role of known/suspected carcinogens contained in uncooked or unprocessed meats, as well as the influence of cooking. Finally, it would be highly recommended to conduct new epidemiological studies to elucidate whether the consumption of white meat, such as pork and/or poultry, are -positively or inversely-associated with an increased risk of CRC and other types of cancer.",2017,cancer
31201224,Adult Overweight and Survival from Breast and Colorectal Cancer in Swedish Women.,"The impact of overweight duration and intensity during adulthood on the prognosis after a cancer diagnosis remains largely unknown. We investigated this association in Swedish women with breast and colorectal cancer. A cohort of 47,051 women from the Swedish Lifestyle and Health Study was included, of whom 1,241 developed postmenopausal breast (mean age at diagnosis, 57.5 years) and 259 colorectal (mean age at diagnosis, 59.1 years) cancer. Trajectories of body mass index (BMI) between ages 20 and 50 years were estimated for the full cohort using a quadratic growth model and studied in relation to risk of death from any cause using multivariate Cox regression models among cancer survivors. Compared with patients with cancer who were never overweight (BMI < 25) during early adulthood (ages 20-50 years), the risk of early death from breast cancer increased by 3% [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.05] and from colorectal cancer by 4% (HR = 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06) for every year lived with overweight. A higher intensity of overweight (i.e., a combination of duration and degree of overweight-a concept comparable to pack-years of cigarette smoking) further increased the risk of dying in this population. Although risks were slightly more pronounced for women diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer, no clear association was found for colorectal cancer. Our results suggest that adulthood overweight duration and intensity have a long-lasting influence on breast and colorectal cancer survival. Our study highlights the need for effective prevention of overweight and obesity starting at an early age.",2019,cancer
36558416,"Obesity, Fat Distribution and Risk of Cancer in Women and Men: A Mendelian Randomisation Study.","Obesity and upper-body fat distribution are independent, cardiometabolic risk factors but whether they also display comparable associations with cancer risk is unknown. We investigated the causal relationships between body mass index (BMI) and BMI-adjusted waist-to-hip ratio (WHRadjBMI) and cancer risk and searched for potential drivers linking these traits to carcinogenesis using two-sample and multivariable Mendelian randomisation. In women, genetically instrumented higher BMI was associated with lower breast (OR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.93) and higher endometrial (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.55-1.96) cancer risk whilst WHRadjBMI was associated with higher colon cancer risk (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.42). In men, elevated BMI was associated with lower prostate cancer risk (OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.98). Mechanistically, testosterone and insulin mediated 21% and 35%, respectively of the total, genetically determined association of BMI with endometrial cancer risk whilst HDL cholesterol and IGF-1 mediated 40% and 22%, respectively of the association between BMI and breast cancer risk. In men, testosterone mediated 21% of the association between BMI and prostate cancer risk.

The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between meats, dairy products, fat consumption and the risk of CRC in Jordanians. A case-control study was performed at the five largest hospitals in Jordan. Dietary data were collected from 220 diagnosed cases of CRC and 281 healthy disease-free controls. The CRC cases were matched as closely as possible to controls using age, sex, occupation and marital status. The consumption of different levels and frequencies of several food types, including meats, chicken, milk and fish, was found to be associated with the risk of developing CRC. Added fats and oils were inversely associated with CRC risk with odds ratio = 0.33 (95% confidence interval = 0.13-0.83, P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.005). The predominant fat added by cases and controls was olive oil, followed by corn oil.

25915188,Whole Grain Consumption and Breast Cancer: A Case-Control Study in Women.,"Whole grain consumption has long been associated with human health. However, its relationship with breast cancer remains not well understood and appreciated. The aim of this work was to evaluate the association between whole grain consumption and breast cancer in women. A case-control study was designed. Two hundred and fifty consecutive, newly diagnosed breast cancer female patients (56 ± 12 years) and 250 one-to-one age-matched controls were enrolled. A standardized, validated questionnaire assessing various sociodemographic, clinical, lifestyle, and dietary characteristics was applied through face-to-face interviews. Moreover, data on regular consumption of whole grains (i.e., never/rarely, 1-6 times/week, >7 times/week) were recorded. Overall dietary habits were assessed through the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet using the MedDietScore (theoretical range 0-55). Whole grain consumption of more than 7 times/week was associated with a 0.49-fold (odds ratio = 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.29, 0.82) lower likelihood of having breast cancer, after adjustments were made.

34738072,Lipid-Lowering Drug Use and Cancer Incidence and Mortality in the ARIC Study.,"Lipid-lowering drugs, particularly statins, are associated with reduced incidence of certain cancers in some studies. Associations with cancer mortality are not well studied, and whether associations are similar across race is unknown. We conducted a prospective analysis of 12 997 cancer-free participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study who were never users at visit 1 (1987-1989). Ever use, duration of use, and age at first use were modeled as time-dependent variables using Cox regression to estimate associations with total, obesity- and smoking-associated, bladder, breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer incidence and mortality. We ascertained 3869 cancer cases and 1661 cancer deaths in 237 999 or more person-years. At 6 years of follow-up, 70.8% of lipid-lowering drug use was a statin. Compared with never use, ever use was associated with lower total, obesity- and smoking-associated cancer mortality and with colorectal cancer mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.32 to 0.79) and incidence (HR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.92). Inverse associations were consistent by sex and race. Shorter-term use was associated with bladder cancer incidence in men (<10 years: HR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.02 to 2.73). First use at age 60 years or older was inversely associated with: total mortality, obesity- and smoking-associated mortality, and colorectal cancer mortality; and total incidence, obesity- and smoking-associated incidence, and breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer incidence. This study provides additional evidence for inverse associations between lipid-lowering drug use and cancer incidence and mortality but a positive association with bladder cancer incidence in men. Evaluation of the impact of chemoprevention strategies that include lipid-lowering drugs on population-level cancer burden is needed.",2021,cancer
38625645,Metabolic Interaction Between Host and the Gut Microbiota During High-Fat Diet-Induced Colorectal Cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-highest cause of cancer-associated mortality among both men and women worldwide. One of the risk factors for CRC is obesity, which is correlated with a high-fat diet prevalent in Western dietary habits. The association between an obesogenic high-fat diet and CRC has been established for several decades; however, the mechanisms by which a high-fat diet increases the risk of CRC remain unclear. Recent studies indicate that gut microbiota strongly influence the pathogenesis of both high-fat diet-induced obesity and CRC. The gut microbiota is composed of hundreds of bacterial species, some of which are implicated in CRC. In particular, the expansion of facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae, which is considered a microbial signature of intestinal microbiota functional imbalance (dysbiosis), is associated with both high-fat diet-induced obesity and CRC. Here, we review the interaction between the gut microbiome and its metabolic byproducts in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC) during high-fat diet-induced obesity. In addition, we will cover how a high-fat diet can drive the expansion of genotoxin-producing Escherichia coli by altering intestinal epithelial cell metabolism during gut inflammation conditions.",2024,cancer
25245710,Diet and physical activity intervention in colorectal cancer survivors: a feasibility study.,"Evidence that lifestyle factors are associated with better outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors highlights the need for behaviour change interventions. This study examined feasibility and acceptability, and provided an indication of behavioural impact, of a telephone-based, multimodal health behaviour intervention for CRC survivors. Participants were recruited from five London hospitals. Patients (n = 29) who had recently completed treatment for CRC participated in a 12 week intervention. Behavioural goals were to increase physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake, and reduce consumption of red/processed meat and alcohol. Self-report measures of PA and diet were completed in all patients, supplemented by objective measures in a sub-set. Uptake of the study when patients were approached by a researcher was high (72%), compared with 27% contacted by letter. Methods for identifying eligible patients were not optimal. Study completion rate was high (79%), and completers evaluated the intervention favourably. Significant improvements were observed in objectively-measured activity (+70 min/week; p = .004). Gains were seen in diet: +3 F&V portions a day (p < .001), -147 g of red meat a week (p = .013), -0.83 portions of processed meat a week (p = .002). Changes in serum vitamin levels were not statistically significant, but the small sample size provides limited power. Clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life (p < .001) was observed. An intervention combining print materials and telephone consultations was feasible and acceptable, and associated with improvements in PA, diet and quality of life.",2015,cancer
31464407,Diet quality score and survival rate in patients with colorectal cancer.,"Results regarding associations between specific-food and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) are limited and inconsistent, and few studies have examined this issue in Asian population. This study examined the association between diet and prognosis of CRC, and developed a diet quality score for prognosis of CRC. 352 participants who provided completed dietary information were recruited during 2004 to 2014, and there are 154 death case documented with 10-year follow-up. Cox regression models were used to examine associations between food groups and survival rate, and to develop the diet quality score for prognosis of CRC. Intake of whole grain, fruit and coffee consumption habitus were associated with higher survival rate (HR 0.56 [95% CI 0.35, 0.89] for whole grain; HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.40, 0.97] for fruit; HR 0.46 [95% CI 0.24, 0.87] for coffee), whereas intake of red meat and frequency of grilled food were associated with lower survival rate (HR 1.68 [95% CI 1.08, 2.61] for red meat; HR 1.78 [95% CI 1.05, 3.02] for grilled food). The overall diet quality based on these nutritional factors was negatively associated with survival rate (HR 1.60 [95% CI 1.07, 2.39] with adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, drinking, energy intake, UICC stage, chemotherapy, postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy, tumor size, carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels. Whole grain, fruit, red meat, coffee consumption habitus and frequency of grilled food were significantly associated with survival rate in Chinese population.

32813487,Correlates of Physical Activity in Colorectal Cancer Patients Based on Health Promotion Model.,"Increasing attention is being given to physical activity in colorectal cancer patients. Some studies have explored a few correlates of physical activity separately. A contemporary study based on the Health Promotion Model may systematically broaden the understanding of physical activity in colorectal cancer patients. To understand the status of physical activity in Chinese colorectal cancer patients and to explore the correlated factors. A total of 168 adults with colorectal cancer were recruited at 3 tertiary hospitals in China. Participant data were collected on demographics, physical activity, biological factors, anxiety and depression, benefits/barriers to physical activity, self-efficacy, and social support. SAS 8.2 was used for statistical analysis, including descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, single factor analysis, and multiple stepwise regression analysis. Only 25.60% of colorectal cancer survivors reached the requirements of the Colorectal Cancer Survivorship Care Guidelines. Employment states, number of complications, fatigue, body image, depression, perception of benefits/barriers, and self-efficacy were closely correlated with physical activity in Chinese colorectal cancer patients. The physical activity status of patients with colorectal cancer is not optimal. The correlated factors that nurses can take measures to improve are fatigue, body image, depression, perception of benefits/barriers, and self-efficacy, which may improve physical activity in colorectal cancer patients in China. Additional research is needed to determine if improving factors correlated with physical activity will assist with directly increasing physical activity. Nurses should evaluate physical activity of colorectal cancer patients timely and play an active role in health promotion programs to improve colorectal cancer patients' physical activity.",2020,cancer
29096565,Dietary components that counteract the increased risk of colorectal cancer related to red meat consumption.,"Western-style diets are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). In particular, a strong correlation has been documented between CRC and the consumption of large amounts of red meat, especially processed red meat. Compared with white meat, red meat contains high levels of haem iron, a molecule that can exert a variety of genotoxic and other adverse effects on the colonic epithelium. According to current international guidelines, the reduction of red meat intake combined with the consumption of food containing antioxidant and chemoprotective substances may significantly reduce the risk of developing CRC. The dietary strategies that can help to contrast the harmful effects of haem iron are reported and discussed in this review.",2018,cancer
32057702,The interrelationship between physical activity and metabolic regulation of breast cancer progression in obesity via cytokine control.,"Regular physical activity is known to protect against the development of breast cancer and mediate direct anti-inflammatory effects on adipose tissue. While direct relationships between muscle activity, adipose tissue and breast tissue have been highlighted in recent years, few studies have focused on the effects of obesity and physical activity during the development of breast cancer, particularly at the level of cell signaling. Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue modulate the cell metabolism by secreting myokines and adipokines. These secreted cytokines belong to a crosstalk network via cell signaling pathway modulation. The understanding of the tissue crosstalk is fundamental to the management of physical activity in the care of obese breast cancer patients. Therefore, this review focuses on the effects of obesity and physical activity during the development of breast cancer, particularly at the level of cell signaling. We focuse on the main mediators, secreted by both adipose and muscle tissue, which are implicated in breast cancer development. We presente the variation of these mediators in the physiopathological context of their secreted tissue. Then, we open the discussion on the crosstalk of these tissues in breast carcinogenesis.",2020,cancer
39731045,Temporal trends in disability adjusted life year and mortality for colorectal cancer attributable to a high red meat diet in China from 1990 to 2021: an analysis of the global burden of disease study 2021.,"High red meat consumption is a main modifiable risk factor for colorectal cancer mortality (CRC), but its attributable disease burden remains unclear in China. We aimed to analyze the temporal trends in CRC deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to high red meat consumption in China from 1990 to 2021 and to predict the disease burden in the next 15 years. Data was obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study. The Joinpoint regression model was used to calculate the annual percentage change (APC) and the average annual percentage change (AAPC). In addition, the age-period-cohort (APC) model was employed to explore the effects of age, period, and cohort on CRC mortality. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was utilized to predict the disease burden in 2022-2036. We also compared the CRC burden attributed to high red meat in China with 204 countries worldwide. The results showed that the number of CRC deaths in China due to high red meat consumption increased nearly 2.5 times, from 17,608 (95% UI: -3 to 36,613) in 1990 to 43,580 (95% UI: -16 to 92,083) in 2021. Male CRC deaths exhibited a more pronounced increase, rising from 9,800 in 1990 to 27,600 in 2021. Additionally, the number of DALYs increased from 518,213 (95% UI: -105,107 to 1,074,174) in 1990 to 1,091,788 (95% UI: -509 to 2,295,779) in 2021. Joinpoint regression analysis confirmed that the AAPC in ASDR and ASMR was - 0.20 (95% CI: -0.40 ∼ 0.00) and - 0.30 (95% CI: -0.40 ~ -0.10). When age, period, and cohort effects were examined as the reference group, the risk of CRC was found to increase with age. However, women experienced a marked decline in both period and cohort effects compared to men. Compared to global levels, the burden in China is heavier. In terms of mortality or DALY standardized rates, Chinese women show a similar downward trend to the overall trend, while Chinese men show a striking upward trend. This study provides valuable insights into enhancing CRC prevention and improving dietary patterns in China.",2024,cancer
39030837,"A historical cohort study with 27,754 individuals on the association between meat consumption and gastrointestinal tract and colorectal cancer incidence.","In order to explore the association between meat consumption and gastrointestinal/colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and to estimate the Israeli population attributable fraction (PAF), we conducted a collaborative historical cohort study using the individual participant data of seven nutritional studies from the past 6 decades. We included healthy adult men and women who underwent a nutritional interview. Dietary assessment data, using food-frequency or 24-h recall questionnaires, were harmonized. The study file was linked to the National Cancer and death registries. Among 27,754 participants, 1216 (4.4%) were diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancers and 839 (3.0%) with CRC by the end of 2016. Using meta-analysis methods applied to Cox proportional hazard models (adjusted for daily energy intake, sex, age, ethnic origin, education and smoking),100 g/day increments in beef, red meat and poultry consumption, and 50 g/day increment in processed meat consumption were associated with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals of 1.46 (1.06-2.02), 1.15 (0.87-1.52), 1.06 (0.89-1.26), and 0.93 (0.76-1.12), respectively, for CRC. Similar results were obtained for gastrointestinal cancer, although red meat consumption reached statistical significance (HR = 1.27; 95%CI: 1.02-1.58). The PAFs associated with a reduction to a maximum of 50 g/day in the consumption of red meat were 2.7% (95%CI: -1.9 to 12.0) and 5.2% (0.3-13.9) for CRC and gastrointestinal cancers, respectively. Reduction of beef consumption to a maximum of 50 g/day will result in a CRC PAF reduction of 7.5% (0.7%-24.3%). While beef consumption was associated with gastrointestinal/CRC excess risk, poultry consumption was not. A substantial part of processed meat consumption in Israel is processed poultry, perhaps explaining the lack of association with CRC.",2024,cancer

25012881,"Physical activity and awareness in breast screening attendees in Black Country, UK.","This study aimed to determine the physical activity levels and awareness of the influence of physical activity and overweight/obesity on breast cancer risk among NHS breast screening programme (NHSBSP) attendees. One hundred and eighty-eight (white British = 95%; post-menopausal = 80%) attendees completed a demographic and anthropometric data questionnaire, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and awareness of breast cancer risk factors questionnaire. IPAQ data were reported as continuous measures (MET-min · week(-1)) and as categorical variables (low, moderate and high activities). The highest median physical activity levels were reported in the domestic physical activity domain (756 MET-min · week(-1)). Most participants were categorized as 'moderately active' (45%), while 30% were classified in the 'high activity' and 25% as 'low activity' categories. Almost a third of participants (30%) reported no leisure-time physical activity and 83% reported no vigorous physical activity. There was high awareness of the effects of physical activity (75%) and obesity (80%) on breast cancer risk. No significant differences were found between physical activity categories and awareness that physical activity can reduce breast cancer risk (p > 0.05). However, compared with moderate and high activity categories, participants in the 'low activity' category were significantly more likely to respond that they thought they achieved recommended physical activity levels (p < 0.05). Participants who are unaware of their inadequate physical activity levels may have a less positive intention to increase physical activity levels. Practical strategies aimed to increase knowledge of the recommended physical activity guidelines and facilitate the achievement of these guidelines may be required for NHSBSP attendees.",2016,cancer

Despite the number of studies on this topic is rapidly increasing, the relationship between dietary factors, changes in DNA methylation and health outcomes remains unclear. In this review, we summarize the literature from observational studies (cross-sectional, retrospective, or prospective) which examined the association of dietary factors (nutrients, foods, and dietary patterns) with DNA methylation markers among diseased or healthy people during the lifetime. Next, we discuss the methodological pitfalls by examining strengths and limitations of published studies. Finally, we close with a discussion on future challenges of this field of research, raising the need for large-size prospective studies evaluating the association between diet and DNA methylation in health and diseases for appropriate public health strategies.",2020,cancer
40482846,Weighty matters: Unraveling the impact of obesity on colorectal cancer and nutritional interventions.,"This narrative review explores the influence of obesity on colorectal cancer, focusing on obesity-related factors, including chronic inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and gut microbiota imbalance, which collectively create a pro-carcinogenic environment that increases colorectal cancer risk and complicates treatment outcomes. The findings indicate that obesity not only accelerates tumor progression but also presents challenges in colorectal cancer treatment, such as higher rates of surgical complications due to excess adipose tissue and altered pharmacokinetics that can reduce chemotherapy efficacy. Nutritional and lifestyle interventions, particularly weight management and anti-inflammatory nutritional therapies, are highlighted as effective strategies to reduce colorectal cancer risk and support treatment in patients with obesity. The study emphasizes the importance of personalized colorectal cancer treatment approaches for individuals with obesity and calls for public health policies targeting obesity prevention, which could significantly decrease colorectal cancer incidence and healthcare burdens associated with this high-risk population.",2025,cancer
31790930,Revisiting the impact of lifestyle on colorectal cancer risk in a gender perspective.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world. Patterns and trends in CRC incidence and mortality correlate with increasing adoption of Western lifestyles and with the overweight/obesity epidemic. Both genetic background and a range of modifiable environmental/lifestyle factors play a role in CRC etiology. Among these the links of body weight, dietary patterns and physical activity (PA) behavior with CRC risk are some of the strongest for any type of cancer, with a different impact in women and men. Nonetheless, gender disparities still represent a neglected aspect of CRC management. This review sheds light on gender-related association of obesity and different dietary/PA habits with CRC risk, highlighting the importance of lifestyle modifications in the prevention of this neoplastic disease. In this scenario, intervention studies are strongly recommended to define the most effective dietary/PA regimens for primary prevention of cancer in women and men.",2020,cancer
29636539,Dietary and Physical Activity Interventions for Colorectal Cancer Survivors: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"There has been evidence on the protective effects of diets high in fiber and low in red and processed meat (RPM), and physical activity (PA) against colorectal cancer (CRC) development, but that against CRC recurrence has been limited. This study evaluated the efficacy of a behavioral program comprising dietary and PA interventions in improving Chinese CRC survivors' lifestyle. A 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial of 223 CRC patients (82 females, mean age 65), randomly assigned to receive dietary, PA or both interventions, or usual care for 12 months, and assessed every 6 months for 24 months. Primary outcomes included two dietary and two PA targets. Secondary outcomes included changes in dietary consumptions and PA levels. Dietary interventions significantly increased the odds of achieving the targets of consuming less RPM at all time-points (OR 3.22-4.57, all p < 0.01) and refined grain (RG) at months 6 (OR 3.13, p = 0.002) and 24 (OR 2.19, p = 0.039), and reduced RPM (2.49-3.48 servings/week, all p < 0.01) and RG (0.31-0.5 servings/day, all p < 0.01) consumptions.

40773080,Systematic Analysis of the Differential Effects of Red Meat on Colorectal Cancer Risks: A Meta-Analytic Approach.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, with rising incidence in younger populations. Red meat consumption has been proposed as a risk factor for CRC, though the evidence remains inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the associations between the consumption of beef, pork, and lamb with CRC, colon cancer (CC), and rectal cancer (RC) risk. The findings from 27 studies published between 1993 and 2024 were included, involving over 1 million participants from diverse geographical regions. Relative risks were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis, with subgroup and meta-regression analyses performed to assess potential sources of heterogeneity. Beef consumption was significantly associated with increased CRC risk, with a 30% overall risk increase (95% CI: 1.10-1.54). The association with colon cancer (CC) was marginally significant (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.99-1.43, p = 0.0585), while the link to rectal cancer (RC) was not statistically significant. Pork consumption was associated with a 17% increased CRC risk (95% CI: 1.09-1.25), with similar, nonsignificant trends for CC and RC. Lamb consumption was weakly associated with an 11% increase in CRC risk (95% CI: 1.02-1.21), though this was based on limited studies (n = 6), and no significant associations emerged for cancer subtypes. Study design and confounding factors influenced these associations, with case-control studies reporting stronger associations than cohort studies. Physical activity adjustments were pivotal, as studies without this adjustment consistently reported higher-risk estimates. These findings emphasise the importance of accounting several lifestyle factors in future research and public health guidance. While these results support current dietary guidelines recommending limited red meat consumption, they also underscore the complexity of diet-cancer relationships and the need for comprehensive, lifestyle-inclusive cancer prevention strategies.",2025,cancer
35639865,The effects of exercise and diet on sex steroids in breast cancer survivors.,"Insufficient physical activity and obesity are associated with an increased risk of cancer recurrence and death in breast cancer survivors. Sex steroid hormones may mediate these associations. This study tested the hypothesis that exercise and diet, as compared to control, favorably change sex steroid hormones. This analysis of data from a subset of participants in a 2 × 2 factorial trial compares 269 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors who were insufficiently physically active and had overweight or obesity and were randomized to one of four treatment groups for 52 weeks: control, exercise alone, diet alone, or exercise plus diet. Secondary sex steroid hormone endpoints included estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and testosterone. Treatment effects were quantified using a mixed model for repeated measures. Compared to control, exercise alone did not significantly change estradiol (-1.9%; 95% CI: -12.6, 8.8), SHBG (2.4%; 95% CI: -9.9, 14.6), or testosterone (1.2%; 95% CI: -12.2, 14.5). Compared to control, diet alone did not significantly change estradiol (-7.8%; 95% CI: -17.6, 1.9), SHBG (8.2%; 95% CI: -4.2, 20.6), or testosterone (-0.8%; 95% CI: -13.6, 12.0). Compared to control, exercise plus diet did not significantly change estradiol (-6.3%; 95% CI: -16.3, 3.6), SHBG (8.8%; 95% CI: -4.0, 21.7), or testosterone (-5.3%; 95% CI: -18.0, 7.4).

Systematic reviews about physical activity and cancer incidence and cancer mortality in different body sites among general population. We included 19 reviews covering 22 cancer sites, 26 exposure-outcome pairs meta-analyses and 541 original studies. Physical activity was associated with lower risk of seven cancer sites (colon, breast, endometrial, lung, oesophageal, pancreas and meningioma). Only colon (a protective association with recreational physical activity) and breast cancer (a protective association with overall physical activity) were supported by strong evidence and highly suggestive evidence, respectively. Evidence from endometrial, lung, oesophageal, pancreas and meningioma presented hints of uncertainty and bias in the literature (<i>eg,</i> not reaching P values<10<sup>-6</sup>) showing large between-study heterogeneity and/or not demonstrating a definite direction for the effect when 95% prediction intervals were considered. Four of the 26 meta-analyses showed small study effects and 4 showed excess significance.

28426250,Processed Meat and Colorectal Cancer Risk: A Pooled Analysis of Three Italian Case-Control Studies.,"To add evidence to the limited data available from southern Europe, we assessed the association between processed meat consumption and colorectal cancer risk. We analyzed data from three case-control studies conducted between 1985 and 2010 in various Italian areas, including a total of 3745 incident cases and 6804 hospital-based controls. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by unconditional multiple logistic regression models. The median consumption of processed meat was around 20 g/day both in cases and controls. The OR of colorectal cancer was 1.02 (95% CI 0.99-1.04) for an increase of 10 g/day of processed meat. The association was statistically significant for colon cancer (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), particularly for proximal colon cancer (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.14), while there was no relation with rectal cancer (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95-1.03). The OR of proximal colon cancer was 1.38 (95% CI 1.08-1.75) for the highest sex-specific tertile of consumption (>25 g/day for men, >21.5 for women) compared with the lowest (<15 g/day), whereas no significant ORs were found for other anatomical subsites. Our findings indicate that there is no association with colorectal cancer overall, in the presence, however, of a positive association with proximal colon cancer.",2017,cancer
37282602,Associations between polymorphisms in leptin and leptin receptor genes and colorectal cancer survival.,"Leptin (LEP) is an obesity-associated adipokine associated with tumor cell growth. We examined the relevance of genetic variants of <i>LEP</i> and leptin receptor (<i>LEPR</i>) to colorectal cancer (CRC) survival by using data from the Newfoundland Familial Colorectal Cancer Study. A total of 532 patients newly diagnosed with CRC between 1997 and 2003 were followed up until April 2010. Data on their demographics and lifestyles were collected <i>via</i> questionnaires. Genotyping of blood samples was performed with the Illumina Human Omni-Quad Bead chip. Multivariable Cox models were used to assess the relationships of 35 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <i>LEP</i> and <i>LEPR</i> with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and CRC-specific survival. At the gene level, <i>LEP</i> was associated with DFS (<i>P</i> = 0.017), and <i>LEPR</i> was associated with both DFS (<i>P</i> = 0.021) and CRC-specific survival (<i>P</i> = 0.013) in patients with CRC. In single-SNP analysis, <i>LEP</i> rs11763517, <i>LEPR</i> rs9436301, and <i>LEPR</i> rs7602 were associated with DFS after adjustment for multiple testing. The <i>LEPR</i> haplotypes G-C-T (rs7534511-rs9436301-rs1887285) and A-A-G (rs7602-rs970467-rs9436748) were associated with prolonged OS among patients with CRC overall (G-C-T: HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43-0.93; A-A-G: HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.91) and those diagnosed with colon cancer (G-C-T: HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34-0.86; A-A-G: HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29-0.83). Similar results were observed for DFS. Moreover, significant interactions were found among <i>LEPR</i> rs7602 (A <i>vs.</i> G), <i>LEPR</i> rs1171278 (T <i>vs</i>. C), red meat intake, and BMI status: the associations between these variants and prolonged DFS were limited to patients with below-median red meat consumption and body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

33410461,Efforts needed for preventing breast and colorectal cancer through changes in dietary patterns.,"Prospective cohort studies on diet and cancer report risk associations as hazard ratios. But hazard ratios do not inform on the number of people who need to alter their dietary behaviours for preventing cancer. The objective of this study is to estimate the number of people that need to alter their diet for preventing one additional case of female breast or colorectal cancer. Based on the largest prospective studies done in the USA and in Europe, we computed the number of subjects who need to alter their diet. For preventing one case of breast cancer, European women should increase their fruit consumption by 100 g/day during 33 000 person-years, and US women by 60 g/day during 10 600 person-years. For vegetables, European women should increase their consumption by 160 g/day during 26 900 person-years and US women by 100 g/day during 19 000 person-years. For preventing one case of colorectal cancer, European subjects should decrease their red meat consumption by 20 g/day during 26 100 person-years, and US subjects by 30 g/day during 8170 person-years. For processed meat, European subjects should decrease their consumption by 20 g/day during 17 400 person-years, and US subjects by 10 g/day during 7940 person-years. Large number of subjects would need to alter their intake of fruits, vegetables, red and processed meat during many years in order to prevent one additional breast or colorectal cancer.",2021,cancer
37217228,Associations between Physical Activity and Incidence of Cancer among Overweight Adults in Korea: Results from the Health Examinees-G Study.,"Although the protective effects of physical activity against several cancers are well established, evidence is inconsistent concerning Asian populations. Therefore, we assessed the association between the characteristics of physical activity and overall and type-specific cancer incidence in Koreans and examined the differences in association according to obesity status. Using prospective data from 112,108 participants in the Health Examinees study-G from 2004 to 2013, we evaluated the association between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and the incidence of overall and type-specific cancers using the Cox proportional hazards model. Self-reported LTPA participation, duration per week, intensity, type, and diversity were assessed. The incidence of overall and type-specific cancers, including colorectal, gastric, lung, breast, and prostate cancer and 13 obesity-related cancers, was identified using the Korea Central Cancer Registry from 1999 to 2018. Analyses were also stratified according to obesity status. In overweight males, participation in vigorous LTPA [HR, 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72-0.97] and walking (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98) were associated with a lower risk of cancer overall. Regarding cancer types, climbing was marginally associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in overweight males (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37-1.00). In normal-weight females, although there was an increased risk in those performing recreational activities, this risk was attenuated when those diagnosed with thyroid cancer were excluded. In the analysis for 13 obesity-related cancers, consistent associations were found. These findings suggest the need for greater public awareness regarding physical activity among overweight individuals within the Asian population. Overall cancer risk is associated with leisure-time physical activity such as duration, intensity, type, and diversity in overweight males, but not in the general population. The decreased risk was most noticeable for colorectal cancer. Our results suggest that physical activity may reduce the risk of cancer among overweight Asian males.",2023,cancer
30526552,"Diet, obesity and colorectal carcinoma risk: results from a national cancer registry-based middle-eastern study.","Cancer of colon and rectum (colorectal) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. There is a scarcity of published data on the risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC) from the Middle-Eastern countries specifically in Kuwait. Therefore, this matched case-control study sought to examine the risk factors associated with CRC in Kuwait. One hundred and three histopathologically confirmed colorectal cancer cases were recruited from Kuwait Cancer Control Centre Registry. Two hundred and six controls matched with cases (2:1 ratio) on age, gender and nationality were selected from medical, ophthalmology, orthopedic and/ or surgical out-patient clinics at three main general hospitals in Kuwait. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data from cases and controls through face-to-face interview. Adjusted matched odds ratios (mOR<sub>adj</sub>) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using a multivariable conditional logistic regression model. Multivariable conditional logistic regression model showed that cases were 4.3 times more likely to have had attainted obesity (BMI ≥ 30) in their lifetime compared to controls (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 4.3; 95% CI: 1.6-11.4). Compared to controls, cases rarely consumed fruits and vegetable (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 20.8; 95% CI: 4.4-99.5), tended to consume red meat 2-3 times a week (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 3.8; 95% CI: 1.6-8.7) or more than 4 times a week (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 9.4; 95% CI: 2.5-35.4). Reportedly cases compared to controls frequently (nearly every week) suffered from constipation (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 5.6; 95% CI: 1.9-16.5). However, CRC cases were less likely than controls to have been diagnosed in the past with hypercholesterolemia (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2-0.7) or diabetes mellitus type II (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-0.8). Obesity, excessive red meat consumption and infrequent fruits/vegetables intake were associated with an increased CRC risk. Overcoming identified pitfalls in dietary pattern and maintenance of healthy weight may help minimize CRC risk in Kuwait and perhaps other countries in the region. Further studies on genetic basis in conjunction with life styles and dietary factors may unravel their joint contributions to CRC risk and furnish tools for curtailing CRC risk in this and other similar populations.",2018,cancer
36511994,[Risk and protective factors for colorectal cancer].,"RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR COLORECTAL CANCER Behaviour and environment play a more important role than heredity in colorectal carcinogenesis. The proportion of colorectal cancers (CRCs) attributable to occupational exposure, pollution or poor socio- economic status is low. The risk levels on which the French CRC screening recommendations are based are obsolete and need to be updated. An individual with one or two non-advanced adenomas resected at colonoscopy is at low risk of CRC. Only a first-degree family history of CRC in one parent before age 50 or in two parents at any age confers a significant increased risk. Certain diseases or situations that are sources of an increased risk of CRC were not previously considered: cystic fibrosis, radiotherapy and paediatric cancer survivors. New inherited predisposition syndromes associated with a very high risk of CRC have been described in addition to Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis: MUTYH-associated polyposis, constitutional MMR deficiency, Lynch-like, PPAP and X syndromes. Half of all CRCs are related to modifiable risk factors associated with westernized lifestyle such as physical inactivity, junk food and obesity. There is nothing specific about dietary recommendations for the primary prevention of CRC: physical activity, limitation of red and processed meat, increase in dietary fibre and dairy products, limitation of alcohol and avoidance of tobacco.

Our purposes were to estimate the rate and modifiers of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening adherence among underweight women and compare it to other body mass index (BMI) categories. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We used sampling weighted data from 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of age-eligible women (breast cancer screening, <i>n</i> = 163,164; cervical, <i>n</i> = 113,883 and colorectal, <i>n</i> = 128,287). We defined breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening using the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines. We calculated the prevalence of screening among four BMI categories (underweight <18.5, normal weight ≥18.5 to <25, overweight ≥25 to <30, and obese ≥30). Logistic regression models assessed the independent effect of BMI on screening adherence. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Underweight women had significantly lower breast (62.9%), cervical (67.5%), and colorectal (62.6%) cancer screening rates compared to other BMI categories. In logistic regression models, being underweight was associated with decreased odds of breast (odds ratio [OR] = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49-0.88) and cervical (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.34-0.84), but not colorectal (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.66-1.18) cancer screening adherence. We did not demonstrate a significant association between obesity and screening rates for any of the three cancers. Underweight women reported higher rates of smoking and lower levels of educational attainment, income, and insurance coverage compared to all other groups. Higher rates of chronic illness and health access hardship were observed among underweight women. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> BMI variably affects cancer screening. Compared to normal-weight women, being underweight is associated with breast and cervical cancer screening nonadherence. Promoting breast and cervical cancer screening among this currently underserved population may reduce future disparities.",2020,cancer
27913919,A critical overview on the biological and molecular features of red and processed meat in colorectal carcinogenesis.,"A recent investigation by the World Health Organisation (WHO) has found that the consumption of processed meat and potentially red meat promotes carcinogenesis and can increase the risk of colorectal cancer. This literature review aims to summarise both the red and processed meat molecules associated with colorectal carcinogenesis and investigate their relationship with the pathogenic process of colorectal cancer. Literature relating to the carcinogenic effect of red and processed meat molecules was critically reviewed. There are multiple molecules present in red and processed meat with a potential carcinogenic effect on colorectal tissues. Processed meat is more carcinogenic compared to red meat because of the abundance of potent nitrosyl-heme molecules that form N-nitroso compounds. Studies have also noted that other molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines have potential mechanisms for the initiation of colorectal cancer pathogenesis. The non-human sugar molecule N-glycolylneuraminic acid may account for the carcinogenic effects of pork despite its heme content being comparable to that of chicken. Red meat products, especially those that have been processed, have a wide variety of carcinogenic molecules known to increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Thus, the outcome of this review is consistent with the recent findings of WHO.",2017,cancer
30480572,Modifiable Risk Factors for the Development of Breast Cancer in Young Women.,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) women aged 15 to 39 years at diagnosis. An improved understanding of modifiable factors that mitigate the risks of the development of breast cancer may allow for future strategies to reduce the incidence of AYA breast cancer. A literature review was conducted to report upon associations between modifiable lifestyle factors and breast cancer risk. Higher levels of physical activity, lower red meat intake, and higher intake of plants appear to decrease the risk of developing AYA breast cancer, whereas associations between obesity and AYA breast cancer risk were less straightforward. Further research, ideally in large prospective trials, is needed to truly understand modifiable risk factors for the development of AYA breast cancer.",2018,cancer
38347682,Dietary Factors Differ Between Young-Onset and Older-Onset Colorectal Cancer Patients.,"We aimed to evaluate differences in dietary factors between young-onset (diagnosed at ages <50) and older-onset colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC patients diagnosed from 1998 to 2018 reported to the Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry were recruited using mail and telephone. Consented patients completed questionnaires assessing demographics, medical history, and CRC risk factors, including dietary factors. We used multi-variable logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing dietary intake in young-onset vs. older-onset CRC. Analyses included 1,087 young- and 2,554 older-onset CRC patients. Compared to older-onset CRC, young-onset CRC patients had lower intake of vegetables (OR for highest intake vs. lowest = 0.59 CI: 0.55, 0.64) and fruit (OR for highest intake vs. lowest = 0.94 CI: 0.88, 0.99) and higher intake of processed meat (OR for highest intake vs. lowest = 1.82 CI: 1.11, 2.99) and spicy food (OR for highest intake vs. lowest = 1.69 CI: 1.09, 2.61). There was no statistically significant difference between young- and older-onset CRC patients for red meat consumption. Dietary patterns differed between young- and older-onset CRC; young-onset CRC patients had lower intake of vegetables and fruit and higher intakes of processed meat and spicy food.",2024,cancer
32077920,"Meat intake, meat cooking methods, and meat-derived mutagen exposure and risk of sessile serrated lesions.","Red and processed meat, recognized carcinogens, are risk factors for colorectal neoplasia, including polyps, the precursor for colorectal cancer. The mechanism is unclear. One possible explanation is the mutagenic activity of these foods, perhaps due to generation during cooking [e.g., heterocyclic amine (HCA) intake]. Few studies have evaluated meat intake and sessile serrated lesion (SSL) risk, a recently recognized precursor, and no study has evaluated meat cooking methods and meat-derived mutagens with SSL risk. We evaluated intakes of meat, meat cooking methods, and inferred meat mutagens with SSL risk and in comparison to risk of other polyps. Meat, well-done meat, and inferred meat mutagen intakes were evaluated. Polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs among cases (556 hyperplastic polyp, 1753 adenoma, and 208 SSL) and controls (3804) in the large colonoscopy-based, case-control study, the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study. The highest quartile intakes of red meat (OR: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.44, 3.93), processed meat (OR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.30, 3.17), well-done red meat (OR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.34, 3.60), and the HCA 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQX; OR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.49, 4.16) were associated with increased risk of SSLs in comparison to the lowest quartile intake. High intakes of red and processed meats are strongly and especially associated with SSL risk and part of the association may be due to HCA intake. Future studies should evaluate other mechanism(s) and the potential for primary prevention.",2020,cancer
27886411,"Dog ownership and physical activity among breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors.","Dog ownership has been associated with higher rates of physical activity (PA) in several populations but no study to date has focused on cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between dog ownership and PA among cancer survivors and to examine correlates of dog ownership. A stratified random sample of 2062 breast cancer survivors, prostate cancer survivors, and colorectal cancer survivors was mailed a questionnaire assessing PA, social cognitive, dog ownership, demographic, and medical variables. Overall, 25% of the sample was dog owners (DOs). There were no significant differences in moderate, vigorous, or total PA minutes between DOs and non-dog owners. There was a significant difference in light PA minutes in favor of DOs (153 vs 112 minutes; 95% CI = 4 to 77; P = .030), however, this was largely restricted to breast cancer survivors (143 vs 79 minutes; 95% CI = 25 to 102; P = .001) who also reported fewer vigorous PA minutes (18 vs 39 minutes; 95% CI = -42 to -1; P = .042). Survivors were more likely to be DOs if they had breast cancer (P = .054), a higher income (P = .021), radiation therapy (P = .029), chemotherapy (P = .010), were younger (P < .001), employed (P < .001), and a current smoker (P = .015). Few social cognitive variables were associated with DO. Dog ownership among cancer survivors was not associated with moderate-to-vigorous PA but was associated with light PA.

35283438,"Healthy Food Choices, Physical Activity, and Screening Reduce the Risk of Colorectal Cancer.","Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States with an estimated 1,806,590 new cases and 606,520 deaths in 2020. Cancer is a public health concern due to the numbers of cases, financial costs, and morbidity and mortality rates. An estimated 42% of all diagnosed cancers and 45% of cancer deaths in the United States in 2014 could be attributed to modifiable risk factors. Colorectal cancer screening is effective because small polyps take years to grow and turn to cancers allowing for early detection and removal of precancerous polyps. Primary prevention of colorectal cancer by risk factor reduction is also effective as these factors cause over half of colorectal cancer cases and deaths. Physical activity, weight control, healthy dietary choices, and abstinence from alcohol and tobacco are protective. The gastroenterology nurse can assess physical activity and food choices as vital signs and recommend a gradual addition of physical activity and a more plant-based diet with reduced processed food. All nurses need to advocate for policy improvements per our pledge to the Code of Ethics for Nurses.

40511571,Integrative medicine in breast cancer survivorship care.,"Integrative medicine use is prevalent among breast cancer survivors to improve lifestyle and manage symptoms associated with cancer or its treatment. This review provides an overview of integrative therapies used for lifestyle improvement and symptom management in breast cancer patients, including diet and exercise recommendations, mind-body approaches including mindfulness-based intervention, acupuncture, yoga, massage, and dietary supplements. A balanced diet with an emphasis on plant-based foods and limited consumption of red meat, processed meats, alcohol, and refined sugar is recommended for cancer patients and survivors. Physical activity is also important, with recommendations of 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily, aiming for 150 minutes per week. Mind-body approaches such as meditation, yoga have been shown to improve emotional self-regulation, anxiety, depression, and other symptoms. Acupuncture has demonstrated potential benefits for aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal symptoms, hot flashes, peripheral neuropathy, and fatigue. Massage may help address pain, anxiety, stress, and improve quality of life (QoL). Supplement use should be approached with caution, especially during active treatment, due to potential interactions with cancer therapies. The review highlights the role of specialized integrative medicine practitioners, such as naturopathic doctors and acupuncturists, in safely incorporating these therapies into standard cancer care. This collaborative approach supports survivors' diverse needs and empowers them to actively participate in their recovery, ultimately improving health outcomes and QoL. Integrative therapy programs within cancer care institutions can provide structure, guidance, and support for patients to safely incorporate these modalities into their treatment and recovery plans.",2025,cancer

26059937,Risk Reduction from Weight Management and Physical Activity Interventions.,"Obesity and low levels of physical activity are associated with a higher risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality. Currently, over 65% of breast cancer survivors are overweight or obese, and fewer than 30% engage in recommended levels of physical activity. The reason for low adherence to lifestyle guidelines is likely multifactorial. Given the continuing trend of increased obesity and physical inactivity in the United States, worldwide and in breast cancer survivors, more research showing the direct effect of weight loss and/or exercise on breast cancer recurrence and mortality is needed. Many exercise interventions have examined the impact of increasing exercise on changes in quality of life, with most studies showing a favorable effect of exercise on quality of life. Smaller Phase II randomized trials using biomarkers as surrogate endpoints is likely appropriate to answer questions regarding mechanisms of action, exercise type, volume, and intensity, yet a definitive trial of weight loss and exercise on disease-free survival is critical for moving the field forward. Research is also necessary on how to disseminate lifestyle interventions into the clinic and community that lead to clinically meaningful weight losses of at least 5% that are maintained over time, and favorable sustained changes in physical activity levels. Changes in referrals, access, and reimbursement of lifestyle programs may lead to favorable changes in the prevalence of obesity and physical activity in breast cancer survivors and in turn rates of breast cancer recurrence and mortality.",2015,cancer
29289998,Molecular signature of nitric oxide on major cancer hallmarks of colorectal carcinoma.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the one of the most important diseases throughout the world. Several aetiological risk factors, viz. sedentary life style, smoking, alcohol intake, less physical activity, red meat, and microbiota, are associated with the development of CRC. Molecular pathophysiology of CRC implies inflammation, metastasis, apotosis and angiogenesis. Inflammation involves interaction between various immune cells, inflammatory cells, chemokines, cytokines, and pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways, which may lead to signalling towards, tumour cell proliferation, growth, and invasion whereas nitric oxide (NO) has been associated with metastasis, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Therefore, this review emphasises on the potential molecular mechanisms associated with NO with alteration of cancer biomarkers during development of colorectal carcinogenesis.",2018,cancer
41076992,Using gene-environment interactions to explore pathways for colorectal cancer risk.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant public health concern, highlighting the critical need for identifying novel intervention targets for its prevention. We conducted genome-wide interaction analyses for 15 exposures with established or putative CRC risk [body mass index (BMI), height, physical activity, smoking, type 2 diabetes, use of menopausal hormone therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and intake of alcohol, calcium, fibre, folate, fruits, processed meat, red meat, and vegetables], and used interaction estimates to explore pathways and genes underlying CRC risk. The adaptive combination of Bayes Factors (ADABF), and over-representation analysis (ORA) were used for pathway analyses, and findings were further investigated using publicly available resources [hallmarks of cancer, Open Targets Platform (OTP)]. A total of 1973 pathways using ADABF, and 840 pathways using ORA, out of the 2950 analysed, were enriched (P < 0.05) for at least one exposure, as well as 1227 genes within the enriched pathways. Data were available for 811/1227 coding genes in the OTP, 241 of which were supported by strong relative abundance of prior evidence (overall OTP score > 0.05). Fifty percent of the genes (617/1227) mapped to at least one hallmark of cancer, most of which (388/617) pertained to the Sustaining Proliferative Signalling hallmark. Our findings reflect previously established pathways for CRC risk and highlight the emerging importance of several less studied genes. Common pathways were found for several combinations of exposures, potentially suggesting common underlying mechanisms. The results of the present analysis provide a basis for further functional research. If confirmed, they may help elucidate the etiological associations between risk factors and CRC risk and ultimately inform personalized prevention strategies.

33383776,"The Impact of Whole Grain Intake on Gastrointestinal Tumors: A Focus on Colorectal, Gastric, and Esophageal Cancers.","Cereals are one of staple foods in human diet, mainly consumed as refined grains. Nonetheless, epidemiological data indicate that whole grain (WG) intake is inversely related to risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and several cancer types, as well as to all-cause mortality. Particularly responsive to WG positive action is the gastrointestinal tract, daily exposed to bioactive food components. Herein, we shall provide an up-to-date overview on relationship between WG intake and prevention of gastrointestinal tumors, with a particular focus on colorectal, stomach, and esophagus cancers. Unlike refined counterparts, WG consumption is inversely associated with risk of these gastrointestinal cancers, most consistently with the risk of colorectal tumor. Some WG effects may be mediated by beneficial constituents (such as fiber and polyphenols) that are reduced/lost during milling process. Beside health-promoting action, WGs are still under-consumed in most countries; therefore, World Health Organization and other public/private stakeholders should cooperate to implement WG consumption in the whole population, in order to reach nutritionally effective intakes.",2020,cancer

A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was employed in this study, utilizing the inverse-variance weighted method as the primary research method. This MR analysis analyzed data of 3022 colorectal cancer cases and 174,006 controls from the FinnGen database. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with unhealthy lifestyle factors were selected as instrumental variables (IVs), including two obesity-related indicators, BMI (body mass index) and WHR (waist-to-hip ratio). Four phenotypes of smoking (smoking initiation, ever smoked, smoking per day, smoking cessation) and one phenotype of alcohol consumption (drinks per week). Four phenotypes of physical activity (accelerometer-based physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, vigorous physical activity, strenuous sports or other exercises). All SNPs were obtained from published genome-wide association studies. The study found that the obesity-related indicator, higher WHR (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.12-1.70; P = 0.002) were associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and two smoking phenotypes, cigarettes per day(OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.01-1.68; P = 0.042)and smoking initiation (OR = 3.48, 95% CI 1.15-10.55; P = 0.028), were potentially associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. However, there was no evidence to suggest that physical activities and alcohol consumption were associated with colorectal cancer (all p > 0.05). In addition, the study detected no pleiotropy (all p > 0.05). This MR analysis indicates a causal association between a higher waist-to-hip ratio and the risk of colorectal cancer and a suggestive association between smoking and the risk of colorectal cancer among Europeans. These findings contribute to the understanding of the etiology of colorectal cancer and have potential implications for its prevention.",2024,cancer
28256076,Meat consumption and colorectal cancer risk in Japan: The Takayama study.,"Compared with the abundant data from Western countries, evidence regarding meat consumption and colorectal cancer is limited in the Japanese population. We evaluated colorectal cancer risk in relation to meat consumption in a population-based prospective cohort study in Japan. Participants were 13 957 men and 16 374 women aged ≥35 years in September 1992. Meat intake, assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire, was controlled for the total energy intake. The incidence of colorectal cancer was confirmed through regional population-based cancer registries and histological identification from colonoscopy in two main hospitals in the study area. From September 1992 to March 2008, 429 men and 343 women developed colorectal cancer. After adjustments for multiple confounders, a significantly increased relative risk of colorectal cancer was observed in the highest versus lowest quartile of the intake of total and red meat among men; the estimated hazard ratios were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.79) for total meat (P for trend = 0.022), and 1.44 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.89) for red meat (P for trend = 0.009). A positive association between processed meat intake and colon cancer risk was also observed in men. There was no significant association between colorectal cancer and meat consumption in women. These results suggest that the intake of red and processed meat increases the risk of colorectal or colon cancer among Japanese men.

40781184,"Navigating the Colorectal Cancer Maze: Unveiling Pathways To Diagnosis, Management, Pathophysiology and Prevention.","Colorectal cancer is the third most prevalent cancer globally and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. It typically develops over years through the progression of benign polyps to malignancy, driven by genetic alterations-either spontaneous or inherited. This review summarizes current knowledge on colorectal cancer, including its epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic methods, treatment strategies, preventative measures, and research developments, while identifying knowledge gaps to guide future studies. Colorectal cancer is influenced by numerous lifestyle-related risk factors, such as high-calorie diets, processed foods, red meat, smoking, obesity, and alcohol use. Colonoscopy, imaging tests, and biopsies remain essential for diagnosis, while the TNM staging system continues to guide therapeutic decisions. Treatment options range from early-stage surgical interventions to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies in advanced stages, with neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments offering improved outcomes. Experimental therapies, including regorafenib and cancer vaccines, are under investigation. Prevention strategies focus on healthy lifestyles and risk avoidance, alongside screening techniques including fecal occult blood tests, colonoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy. Screening programs emphasize individuals with genetic susceptibility, and clinical trials aim to enhance both screening and therapeutic approaches. Colorectal cancer poses a substantial global health challenge. Advances in diagnostics, treatment, and prevention are promising, but further research is needed to improve management strategies and address gaps in screening. Lifestyle changes and early detection through targeted screening remain critical for reducing the disease burden worldwide.",2025,cancer

The Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study (n=10 026) is a prospective population-based case-control study in northern Israel. Participants were interviewed in-person about their dietary intake and lifestyle using a questionnaire that included a food-frequency questionnaire. Red meat consumption in Israel was found to be especially low in the Jewish population (1.29±1.45 servings/week), but higher in Arabs (3.0±1.98 servings/week) (P<0.001). Beef was the most commonly consumed red meat by Jews (1.15/1.29 servings/week, 89%) and proportionally less so by Arabs (2.00/3.00, 67%). Processed meat consumption (mostly pork free) was lower among Arabs (0.9±1.56 servings/week) compared with Jews (1.97±2.97 servings/week) (P<0.001). The adjusted odds of CRC per one serving/week of red meat were 1.05 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.08) in Jews and 0.94 (0.88-1.01) in Arabs. Compared with no consumption, beef consumption was associated with odds ratio (OR)=0.96 (0.86-1.07) in Jews and 0.94 (0.61-1.45) in Arabs, lamb consumption with OR=1.28 (1.10-1.5) and 1.01 (0.75-1.37), pork consumption with OR=1.44 (1.24-1.67) and 1.07 (0.73-1.56), and processed meat consumption with OR=1.22 (1.10-1.35) and 1.04 (0.82-1.33) in Jews and Arabs, respectively.

The present study addressed this issue by undertaking a pooled analysis of large population-based cohort studies in Japan: 5 studies comprising 232 403 participants (5694 CRC cases) for analysis based on frequency of meat intake, and 2 studies comprising 123 635 participants (3550 CRC cases) for analysis based on intake quantity. Study-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model and then pooled using the random effect model. Comparing the highest vs lowest quartile, beef intake was associated with an increased risk of colon cancer in women (pooled HR 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.44) and distal colon cancer (DCC) risk in men (pooled HR 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61). Frequent intake of pork was associated with an increased risk of distal colon cancer in women (pooled HR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.10-1.87) for ""3 times/wk or more"" vs ""less than 1 time/wk"". Frequent intake of processed red meat was associated with an increased risk of colon cancer in women (pooled HR 1.39; 95% CI, 0.97-2.00; P trend = .04) for ""almost every day"" vs ""less than 1 time/wk"". No association was observed for chicken consumption. The present findings support that intake of beef, pork (women only), and processed red meat (women only) might be associated with a higher risk of colon (distal colon) cancer in Japanese.",2019,cancer
37013476,Associations of combined physical activity and body mass index groups with colorectal cancer survival outcomes.,"Physical activity and BMI have been individually associated with cancer survivorship but have not yet been studied in combinations in colorectal cancer patients. Here, we investigate individual and combined associations of physical activity and BMI groups with colorectal cancer survival outcomes. Self-reported physical activity levels (MET hrs/wk) were assessed using an adapted version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) at baseline in 931 patients with stage I-III colorectal cancer and classified into 'highly active' and'not-highly active'(≥ / < 18 MET hrs/wk). BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was categorized into 'normal weight', 'overweight', and 'obese'. Patients were further classified into combined physical activity and BMI groups. Cox-proportional hazard models with Firth correction were computed to assess associations [hazard ratio (HR), 95% profile HR likelihood confidence interval (95% CI) between individual and combined physical activity and BMI groups with overall and disease-free survival in colorectal cancer patients. 'Not-highly active' compared to 'highly active' and 'overweight'/ 'obese' compared to 'normal weight' patients had a 40-50% increased risk of death or recurrence (HR: 1.41 (95% CI: 0.99-2.06), p = 0.03; HR: 1.49 (95% CI: 1.02-2.21) and HR: 1.51 (95% CI: 1.02-2.26), p = 0.04, respectively). 'Not-highly active' patients had worse disease-free survival outcomes, regardless of their BMI, compared to 'highly active/normal weight' patients. 'Not-highly active/obese' patients had a 3.66 times increased risk of death or recurrence compared to 'highly active/normal weight' patients (HR: 4.66 (95% CI: 1.75-9.10), p = 0.002). Lower activity thresholds yielded smaller effect sizes. Physical activity and BMI were individually associated with disease-free survival among colorectal cancer patients. Physical activity seems to improve survival outcomes in patients regardless of their BMI.",2023,cancer
25489716,Association between adiponectin polymorphisms and the risk of colorectal cancer.,"To discuss the association between adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene rs2241766 and rs1501299 polymorphisms and the risk of colorectal cancer, and to analyze the role of the interaction between these two loci and environmental factors in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. The case-control study was performed with a 1:1 match. A self-designed questionnaire was used to perform a face-to-face survey with 600 new primary colorectal cancer cases confirmed by histopathology as well as 600 cases of people receiving a physical examination at the same time. The general information, lifestyle, and diet habits, etc. were collected from two groups of study subjects. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to identify ADIPOQ rs2241766 and rs1501299 genotypes. After adjusting for factors such as colorectal cancer family history, body-mass index (BMI), daily sedentary time, weekly red meat intake frequency, as well regular tea drinking, conditional logistic regression analysis indicated that rs2241766 TG+GG carriers had a higher risk of colorectal cancer than TT carriers (OR=1.433, 95% CI: 1.014-1.985); rs1501299 GT+TT carriers had a lower risk of colorectal cancer than GG carriers (OR=0.723, 95% CI: 0.531-0.902). Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis showed that ADIPOQ rs2241766 and rs1501299 could have interaction with red meat intake (p=0.001). ADIPOQ rs2241766 and rs1501299 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could be associated with colorectal pathogenesis and could have interactions with red meat intake. Both factors impact colorectal cancer occurrence.",2015,cancer
30486551,Association between Dietary and Lifestyle Indices and Colorectal Cancer in Oman: A Case-Control Study.,"Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. CRC vary on the basis of both the biologic features of the disease and its associated lifestyle characteristics. The risk of CRC increases with several modifiable factors including obesity, physical inactivity, a diet high in red or processed meat, heavy alcohol consumption, and possibly inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables. We aimed to establish a baseline data for dietary and lifestyle characteristics of Omani adults diagnosed with CRC. Methods: A Case control study conducted at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, a referral hospital for CRC patients in Oman, and included 279 subjects (109 diagnosed CRC cases and 170 matched controls). All study subjects were recruited on volunteer basis and personally interviewed for preset questions related to sociodemographic data, anthropometric assessment, dietary intake and physical activity. Results: There was no significant difference between cases and controls regarding smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity and dietary fiber intake. However the enrolled cases were more overweight (OR =3.27. 95% CI: 1.91, 7.27), and, had a higher caloric (p =0.001) and macronutrient intake (carbohydrate: p = 0.001; protein: p = 0.017; saturated fat: P = 0.034) than the controls. In addition, the dietary pattern of the cases was characterized by a trend towards low vegetables and fruits intake. Conclusion: CRC maybe prevented through dietary management of high risk groups. This primary prevention approach will ultimately reduce the burden of CRC in Oman.",2018,cancer
36515770,Effects of behavioral change techniques on diet and physical activity in colorectal cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To investigate the effect of behavior change technology on diet, exercise, and sedentary behaviors in colorectal cancer over the last decade. This study systematically searched six English databases (Cochrane Library, EMBASE, APA PsycInfo, SCOPUS, PubMed, Web of Science) and three Chinese databases (CNKI, WanFang, and SINOMEd), searched for eligible clinical trials published between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2021. Each database follows the principle of PICOS and adopts the method of subject words combined with free words to conduct literature retrieval, such as ""colorectal cancer"" and ""behavior change intervention."" Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Continuous data using the same measurement tools were analyzed using weighted mean difference (MD). Otherwise, standard mean difference (SMD) was used for analysis. The confidence interval is 95%. There was no significant statistical heterogeneity between the studies (P > 0.1, I<sup>2</sup> < 50%), and fixed-effects model was used. There was statistical heterogeneity (P ≤ 0.1), I<sup>2</sup> ≥ 50%), and the random effects model was used for analysis. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. In total, 15 good-quality randomized controlled trials were identified. Six studies focused on eating habits. Twelve studies focused on physical activity. We found that behavior change techniques had significant effects on colorectal cancer survivors' eating behaviors such as frequency of fruit and vegetable intake and mastery of dietary knowledge (P < 0.05). The meta-analysis showed that the amount of physical activity in the intervention group increased by 71.76 min/w (16.27 to 127.24, P = 0.01) at 3 months after treatment compared with the control group. The meta-analysis showed that the amount of physical activity in the intervention group increased by 113.97 min/w (48.34 to 179.59, P < 0.001) at 6 months after treatment compared with the control group. The results revealed significant difference in the overall effect of the behavior change technique on the amount of exercise. Behavior change techniques were not found to have significant effects on body weight and BMI in colorectal cancer survivors, but it had a significant effect on sedentary behavior (P < 0.05). The effects of behavioral change technique intervention on diet and physical activity may be more clinically significant at 6 months. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the effectiveness of a behavioral change techniques health behavior intervention in patients with colorectal cancer.",2022,cancer
37309215,Adherence to the 2018 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research Cancer Prevention Recommendations and cancer risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research Cancer Prevention Recommendations are lifestyle-based guidelines that aim to reduce cancer risk. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating associations between a score for adherence to the 2018 Cancer Prevention Recommendations and cancer risk was conducted. MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for studies published to November 28, 2022. In meta-analysis, the estimated risk ratios and 95% CIs for adherence score as a continuous (per 1-point increment) and categorical (highest vs. lowest score category) variable using random-effects models were estimated. Eighteen studies (11 cohort; seven case-control) were included investigating incidence of breast (n = 7), colorectal (n = 5), prostate (n = 2), lung (n = 2), pancreatic (n = 1), endometrial (n = 1), unknown primary cancer (n = 1), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1), and overall (any) cancer (n = 1). The summary risk ratio per 1-point increment in adherence score was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.93; I<sup>2</sup>  = 76.5%; n = 7) for breast cancer, 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91; I<sup>2</sup>  = 26.2%; n = 4) for colorectal cancer, and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.86-0.98, I<sup>2</sup>  = 66.0%; n = 2) for lung cancer. There were no significant associations with prostate or other cancers. Meta-analysis results using categorical adherence score variables were consistent with these findings. Greater adherence to the 2018 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research Cancer Prevention Recommendations was associated with lower risk of breast, colorectal, and lung cancers. Future studies investigating associations with risk of other forms of cancer are warranted. CRD42022313327.",2023,cancer
28927785,"Do alcoholic beverages, obesity and other nutritional factors modify the risk of familial colorectal cancer? A systematic review.","Individuals with family history of colorectal cancer are at higher risk of colorectal cancer than the general population. Until now, guidelines for familial colorectal cancer risk have only pointed at early diagnosis efforts via screening tests and surveillance, and payed scarce or no attention to lowering exposure to modifiable risk factors, notably nutritional factors. We conducted a systematic review of epidemiological studies investigating the associations between nutritional factors, family history of colorectal cancer, and colorectal cancer risk. From the 5312 abstracts identified until December 2016, 184 full text articles were examined for eligibility. Finally, 31 articles (21 from case-control studies, 9 from cohort studies and 1 from an intervention study) met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Mainly, the combinations of family history of colorectal cancer and higher consumptions of alcoholic beverages, red or processed meat, or overweight/obesity increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Consistently, a strong increase is observed with the combinations of family history of colorectal cancer and unhealthy dietary patterns/lifestyles. Statistically significant interactions between these nutritional factors, family history of colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer risk are reported. Other data are inconclusive and additional prospective studies are needed. For the first time, our findings highlight that addressing high consumption of alcoholic beverages, red or processed meat, and overweight/obesity, and more largely the exposure to multiple unhealthy dietary/nutritional behaviors could offer new perspectives of prevention to individuals with family history of colorectal cancer. A better information of these patients and of health professionals on these nutritional modifiable risk factors is recommended.",2017,cancer
31694233,A Review of the In Vivo Evidence Investigating the Role of Nitrite Exposure from Processed Meat Consumption in the Development of Colorectal Cancer.,"The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) 2007 stated that the consumption of processed meat is a convincing cause of colorectal cancer (CRC), and therefore, the public should avoid it entirely. Sodium nitrite has emerged as a putative candidate responsible for the CRC-inducing effects of processed meats. Sodium nitrite is purported to prevent the growth of <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> and other food-spoiling bacteria, but recent, contradictory peer-reviewed evidence has emerged, leading to media reports questioning the necessity of nitrite addition. To date, eleven preclinical studies have investigated the effect of consuming nitrite/nitrite-containing meat on the development of CRC, but the results do not provide an overall consensus. A sizable number of human clinical studies have investigated the relationship between processed meat consumption and CRC risk with widely varying results. The unique approach of the present literature review was to include analysis that limited the human studies to those involving only nitrite-containing meat. The majority of these studies reported that nitrite-containing processed meat was associated with increased CRC risk. Nitrite consumption can lead to the formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOC), some of which are carcinogenic. Therefore, this focused perspective based on the current body of evidence links the consumption of meat containing nitrites and CRC risk.",2019,cancer
26050563,Inflammatory potential of diet and risk of colorectal cancer: a case-control study from Italy.,"Diet and inflammation have been suggested to be important risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC). In the present study, we examined the association between the dietary inflammatory index (DII) and the risk of CRC in a multi-centre case-control study conducted between 1992 and 1996 in Italy. The study included 1225 incident colon cancer cases, 728 incident rectal cancer cases and 4154 controls hospitalised for acute non-neoplastic diseases. The DII was computed based on dietary intake assessed using a validated seventy-eight-item FFQ that included assessment of alcohol intake. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the OR adjusted for age, sex, study centre, education, BMI, alcohol drinking, physical activity and family history of CRC. Energy intake was adjusted using the residual method. Subjects with higher DII scores (i.e. with a more pro-inflammatory diet) had a higher risk of CRC, with the DII being used both as a continuous variable (OR(continuous) 1.13, 95 % CI 1.09, 1.18) and as a categorical variable (OR(quintile 5 v. 1) 1.55, 95 % CI 1.29, 1.85; P for trend < 0.0001). Similar results were observed when the analyses were carried out separately for colon and rectal cancer cases. These results indicate that a pro-inflammatory diet is associated with an increased risk of CRC.",2015,cancer
29759553,The role of heme iron molecules derived from red and processed meat in the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma.,"Emerging evidence that heme iron in red meat is a risk factor for colorectal carcinogenesis is a topic that has received recent scrutiny. This review aims to summarise the mechanism of colorectal carcinogenesis by heme contained in red and processed meat. Heme iron can induce cytotoxicity by 'cytotoxic heme factor' and promote surface epithelial cell apoptosis and compensatory epithelial hyperplasia. Heme, induces peroxidation of lipids, leading to free radical formation and generation of DNA adducts in colorectal epithelial cells. In addition, heme catalyses the formation of N-nitroso-compounds, which in turn results in the initiation of colorectal carcinogenesis. Emerging data suggest that intestinal dysbiosis can promote carcinogenic properties of heme. Heme induces multiple genetic alterations by regulating WNT signalling pathway and causing mutations in major colon cancer genes such as APC, TP53 and KRAS. However, a balanced diet containing green vegetables, olive oil and calcium may reduce the carcinogenic effects of heme.",2018,cancer
26173977,Correlates of physical activity among colorectal cancer survivors: results from the longitudinal population-based profiles registry.,"Physical activity can improve health of cancer survivors. To increase physical activity levels among colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors, we need to understand which factors affect physical activity. Therefore, this study examined the longitudinal relationship between symptom-related, functioning-related, and psychological barriers and socio-demographic and clinical factors with physical activity among CRC survivors. CRC survivors identified from the population-based Eindhoven Cancer Registry (ECR) diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 were included. Survivors completed validated questionnaires measuring moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and barriers in 2010(T1), 2011(T2), and 2012(T3). Linear-mixed models and linear regression techniques were used. Response rates were 74 % (N = 2451, T1); 47 % (N = 1547, T2); and 41 % (N = 1375, T3). Several factors were negatively associated with MVPA: symptom-related barriers (e.g., fatigue, dyspnea, chemotherapy side effects, pain, appetite loss, and weight loss); psychological barriers (i.e., depressive symptoms and anxiety); functioning-related barriers (e.g., low physical or role functioning, unfavorable future perspective); socio-demographic (i.e., older age, female, no partner); and clinical factors (i.e., obesity). However, no within-subject effects were significantly associated with MVPA. Groups of functioning-related barriers, socio-demographic factors, symptom-related barriers, psychological barriers, and clinical factors explained 11, 3.9, 3.8, 2.4, and 2.2 % of the variance in MVPA at T1, respectively. Several functioning-related and symptom-related barriers and few socio-demographic factors were associated with physical activity among CRC survivors. Future interventions to promote physical activity among CRC survivors could benefit by taking into account functioning aspects and symptoms of cancer and its treatment, and assess the causal direction of these associations.",2016,cancer
25342387,"Red meat intake, NAT2, and risk of colorectal cancer: a pooled analysis of 11 studies.","Red meat intake has been associated with risk of colorectal cancer, potentially mediated through heterocyclic amines. The metabolic efficiency of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) required for the metabolic activation of such amines is influenced by genetic variation. The interaction between red meat intake, NAT2 genotype, and colorectal cancer has been inconsistently reported. We used pooled individual-level data from the Colon Cancer Family Registry and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium. Red meat intake was collected by each study. We inferred NAT2 phenotype based on polymorphism at rs1495741, highly predictive of enzyme activity. Interaction was assessed using multiplicative interaction terms in multivariate-adjusted models. From 11 studies, 8,290 colorectal cancer cases and 9,115 controls were included. The highest quartile of red meat intake was associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer compared with the lowest quartile [OR, 1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29-1.55]. However, a significant association was observed only for studies with retrospective diet data, not for studies with diet prospectively assessed before cancer diagnosis. Combining all studies, high red meat intake was similarly associated with colorectal cancer in those with a rapid/intermediate NAT2 genotype (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.20-1.59) as with a slow genotype (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.28-1.61; P interaction = 0.9). We found that high red meat intake was associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer only from retrospective case-control studies and not modified by NAT2 enzyme activity. Our results suggest no interaction between NAT2 genotype and red meat intake in mediating risk of colorectal cancer.",2015,cancer
29304763,Attributable causes of colorectal cancer in China.,"Colorectal cancer is the 4th common cancer in China. Most colorectal cancers are due to modifiable lifestyle factors, but few studies have provided a systematic evidence-based assessment of the burden of colorectal cancer incidence and mortality attributable to the known risk factors in China. We estimated the population attributable faction (PAF) for each selected risk factor in China, based on the prevalence of exposure around 2000 and relative risks from cohort studies and meta-analyses. Among 245,000 new cases and 139,000 deaths of colorectal cancer in China in 2012, we found that 115,578 incident cases and 63,102 deaths of colorectal cancer were attributable to smoking, alcohol drinking, overweight and obesity, physical inactivity and dietary factors. Low vegetable intake was the main risk factor for colorectal cancer with a PAF of 17.9%. Physical inactivity was responsible for 8.9% of colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. The remaining factors, including high red and processed meat intake, low fruit intake, alcohol drinking, overweight/obesity and smoking, accounted for 8.6%, 6.4%, 5.4%, 5.3% and 4.9% of colorectal cancer, respectively. Overall, 45.5% of colorectal cancer incidence and mortality were attributable to the joint effects of these seven risk factors. Tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, low vegetable intake, low fruit intake, and high red and processed meat intake were responsible for nearly 46% of colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in China in 2012. Our findings could provide a basis for developing guidelines of colorectal cancer prevention and control in China.",2018,cancer
37686892,Post-Diagnosis Dietary Patterns among Cancer Survivors in Relation to All-Cause Mortality and Cancer-Specific Mortality: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies.,"The role of overall diet on longevity among cancer survivors (CS) needs further elucidation. We performed a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of related cohort studies published up to October 2022 investigating post-diagnosis a priori (diet quality indices) and a posteriori (data-driven) dietary patterns (DPs) in relation to all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using random-effects meta-analyses comparing highest versus lowest categories of adherence to DPs. We assessed heterogeneity and risk of bias in the selected studies. A total of 19 cohort studies with 38,846 adult CS, some assessing various DPs, were included in the meta-analyses. Higher adherence to a priori DPs was associated with lower all-cause mortality by 22% (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.73-0.83, I<sup>2</sup> = 22.6%) among all CS, by 22% (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.73-0.84, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) among breast CS and by 27% (HR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.62-0.86, I<sup>2</sup> = 41.4%) among colorectal CS. Higher adherence to a ""prudent/healthy"" DP was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64-0.97 I<sup>2</sup> = 49.3%), whereas higher adherence to a ""western/unhealthy"" DP was associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.26-1.74, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) among all CS. Results for cancer-specific mortality were less clear. In conclusion, higher adherence to a ""healthy"" DP, either a priori or a posteriori, was inversely associated with all-cause mortality among CS. A ""healthy"" overall diet after cancer diagnosis could protect and promote longevity and well-being.",2023,cancer
34705528,Effect of metformin on <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and positron emission tomographic imaging.,"Metformin is widely used to treat diabetes, but induces changes in glucose uptake in both normal organs and tumors. Here, we review the effects of metformin on the uptake of <b><sup>1</sup></b><sup>8</sup>F-fludeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) in tissues and tumors, and its influence on <sup>18</sup>F-FDG positron emission tomographic imaging (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET), as well as the mechanisms involved. This is an important issue, because metformin has diverse effects on tissue uptake of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG, and this can affect the quality and interpretation of PET images. Metformin increases glucose uptake in the gastrointestinal tract, cerebral white matter, and the kidney, while regions of the cerebrum associated with memory show decreased glucose uptake, and the myocardium shows no change. Hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer show increased glucose uptake after metformin administration, while thyroid cancer shows decreased uptake, and colon and pancreatic cancers show no change. A high-energy diet increases <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake, but this effect is blocked by metformin. Withdrawal of metformin 48 h before PET image acquisition is widely recommended. However, based on our review of the literature, we propose that the differentiation of metformin discontinuation could be reasonable.

We aimed to examine the recent available evidence from observational studies about the association between these food groups’ intake and CRC risk. For this systematic review, we searched the PubMed database for the last five years. A total of fourteen cohort studies and seven case−control studies comprising a total of >60,000 cases were included. The studies showed a consistent significant decrease in CRC risk, overall and by subsites, associated with a high consumption of total dairy products. Less strong effects associated with the consumption of any subtype of dairy product were observed. Fish consumption, overall and by subtypes (oily or non-oily and fresh or canned), showed a mild inverse association with CRC risk. The association between white meat and egg intake and CRC risk was low and based on a small number of studies; thus, these findings should be interpreted with caution. In conclusion, a high consumption of total dairy products was associated with a lower CRC risk. However, evidence for fish, white meat, and eggs and the CRC risk were not as strong.",2022,cancer
37649268,The association of diet-dependent acid load with colorectal cancer risk: a case-control study in Korea.,"Acid-base disequilibrium is a contributor to cancer development because it affects molecular activities such as insulin-like growth factor 1 levels and adiponectin production. However, evidence of an association of diet-induced acid-base imbalance with colorectal cancer (CRC) is limited. We examined whether colorectal carcinogenesis is attributable to a diet with a high acid load. We recruited a total of 923 CRC cases and 1846 controls at the National Cancer Center in Korea for inclusion in a case-control study. We collected information on nutrient intake and specific clinical parameters of CRC by using a semiquantitative FFQ and medical records, respectively. Potential renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) were used to estimate diet-dependent acid load. We used an unconditional logistic regression model to analyse the association. Dietary acid load scores had a positive association with the odds of CRC (OR = 2·31 (95 % CI 1·79, 2·99) and OR = 2·14 (95 % CI 1·66, 2·76) for PRAL and NEAP, respectively, <i>P</i><sub>for trend</sub> < 0·001). A stronger positive association was observed for females (OR = 3·09, 95 % CI 1·93, 4·94) than for males (OR = 1·71, 95 % CI 1·27, 2·31). Furthermore, acidogenic diets appeared to affect rectal cancer more strongly than colon cancer in females. Our study contributes to reinforcing epidemiological evidence regarding a detrimental effect of acidogenic diets on colorectal carcinogenesis. Thus, it is important to pay attention to the balance of acidogenic (e.g. poultry and red meat) and alkalinogenic foods (e.g. fruits and vegetables) in CRC prevention, especially for females.",2024,cancer
26773096,Obesity-Induced Colorectal Cancer Is Driven by Caloric Silencing of the Guanylin-GUCY2C Paracrine Signaling Axis.,"Obesity is a well-known risk factor for colorectal cancer but precisely how it influences risks of malignancy remains unclear. During colon cancer development in humans or animals, attenuation of the colonic cell surface receptor guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY2C) that occurs due to loss of its paracrine hormone ligand guanylin contributes universally to malignant progression. In this study, we explored a link between obesity and GUCY2C silencing in colorectal cancer. Using genetically engineered mice on different diets, we found that diet-induced obesity caused a loss of guanylin expression in the colon with subsequent GUCY2C silencing, epithelial dysfunction, and tumorigenesis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that obesity reversibly silenced guanylin expression through calorie-dependent induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response in intestinal epithelial cells. In transgenic mice, enforcing specific expression of guanylin in intestinal epithelial cells restored GUCY2C signaling, eliminating intestinal tumors associated with a high calorie diet. Our findings show how caloric suppression of the guanylin-GUCY2C signaling axis links obesity to negation of a universal tumor suppressor pathway in colorectal cancer, suggesting an opportunity to prevent colorectal cancer in obese patients through hormone replacement with the FDA-approved oral GUCY2C ligand linaclotide.",2016,cancer

Five literature databases were systematically searched to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of tailored physical activity and/or dietary interventions with follow-up support initiated through colorectal and breast cancer screening programmes. Outcomes included markers of body fatness, physical activity, and dietary intake. Mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random effects models. Five RCTs met the inclusion criteria encompassing a total of 722 participants. Diet and physical activity interventions led to statistically significant reductions in body mass (MD - 1.6 kg, 95% CI - 2.7 to - 0.39 kg; I<sup>2</sup> = 81%; low quality evidence), body mass index (MD - 0.78 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI - 1.1 to - 0.50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; I<sup>2</sup> = 21%; moderate quality evidence), and waist circumference (MD - 2.9 cm, 95% CI - 3.8 to - 1.91; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; moderate quality evidence), accompanied by an increase in physical activity (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.50; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; low quality evidence) and fruit and vegetable intake (SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.64; I<sup>2</sup> = 51%; low quality evidence). There is low quality evidence that lifestyle interventions involving follow-up support lead to modest weight loss and increased physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake. Due to the modest intervention effects, low quality of evidence and small number of studies, further rigorously designed RCTs with long-term follow-up of modifiable risk factors and embedded cost-benefit analyses are warranted (PROSPERO ref: CRD42020179960).",2021,cancer
28249812,Dietary Patterns and Risk of Colorectal Cancer: Analysis by Tumor Location and Molecular Subtypes.,"Western and prudent dietary patterns have been associated with higher and lower risks of colorectal cancer (CRC), respectively. However, little is known about the associations between dietary patterns and specific anatomic subsites or molecular subtypes of CRC. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to examine the associations between Western and prudent dietary patterns and CRC risk in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Nurses' Health Study. After up to 32 years of follow-up of 137,217 men and women, we documented 3260 cases of CRC. Among individuals from whom subsite data were available, we observed 1264 proximal colon, 866 distal colon, and 670 rectal tumors. Western diet was associated with an increased incidence of CRC (P<sub>trend</sub> < .0001), with a relative risk (RR) of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.15-1.48, comparing the highest to lowest quartile). The association of Western diet with CRC was evident for tumors of the distal colon (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.22-1.96; P<sub>trend</sub> = .0004) and rectum (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.03-1.77; P<sub>trend</sub> = .01) but not proximal colon (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.91-1.35; P<sub>trend</sub> = .51) when we comparing extreme quartiles. In contrast, for the prudent pattern, we observed a RR of 0.86 for overall CRC (95% CI, 0.77-0.95; P<sub>trend</sub> = .01), with similar trends at anatomic subsites. However, the trend appeared stronger among men than women. Among 1285 cases (39%) with tissue available for molecular profiling, Western diet appeared to be more strongly associated with some CRC molecular subtypes (no mutations in KRAS [KRAS wildtype] or BRAF [BRAF wildtype], no or a low CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite stability), although formal tests for heterogeneity did not produce statistically significant results. Western dietary patterns are associated with an increased risk of CRC, particularly distal colon and rectal tumors. Western dietary patterns also appear more strongly associated with tumors that are KRAS wildtype, BRAF wildtype, have no or a low CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite stability. In contrast, prudent dietary patterns are associated with a lower risk of CRC that does not vary according to anatomic subsite or molecular subtype.",2017,cancer
