cancer_35361331,35361331,cancer,2022.0,"Risk Factors for Colorectal Polyps and Cancer.. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy in the U.S. and worldwide. Most CRC cases arise from precancerous adenomatous and serrated polyps. Established risk factors for conventional adenomas and CRC include age, male sex, family history, obesity and physical inactivity, and red meat intake. White race and tobacco and alcohol use are important risk factors for serrated polyps, which have a distinct risk factor profile compared to conventional adenomas. A history of abdominopelvic radiation, acromegaly, hereditary hemochromatosis, or prior ureterosigmoidostomy also increases CRC risk. Understanding these risk factors allows for targeted screening of high-risk groups to reduce CRC incidence.",pubmed

Adopting a healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity, is widely believed to decrease cancer risk. This study aimed to quantitatively establish the dose-response relationships between total physical activity and the risk of breast, colon, lung, gastric, and liver cancers. A systematic review and dose-response analysis were conducted using PubMed and Embase from January 1, 1980 to March 20, 2023. Prospective cohort studies that examined the association between physical activity and the risks of any of the 5 outcomes were included. The search was confined to publications in the English language with a specific focus on human studies. Physical activity is standardized by using the data from US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) and the Global Burden of Disease 2019 database. A total of 98 studies, involving a combined population of 16,418,361 individuals, were included in the analysis. Among the included studies, 57 focused on breast cancer, 17 on lung cancer, 23 on colon cancer, 5 on gastric cancer, and 7 on liver cancer. Overall, elevated levels of physical activity exhibited an inverse correlation with the risk of cancer. The dose-response curve for lung cancer exhibited a non-linear pattern, with the greatest benefit risk reduction observed at 13,200 MET-minutes/week of physical activity, resulting in a 14.7% reduction in risk (relative risk 0.853, uncertainty interval 0.798 to 0.912) compared to the inactive population. In contrast, the dose-response curves for colon, gastric, breast, and liver cancers showed linear associations, indicating that heightened levels of total physical activity were consistently associated with reduced cancer risks. However, the increase in physical activity yielded a smaller risk reduction for colon and gastric cancers compared to breast and liver cancers. Compared to individuals with insufficient activity (total activity level < 600 MET-minutes/week), individuals with high levels of activity (≥ 8,000 MET-minutes/week) experienced a 10.3% (0.897, 0.860 to 0.934) risk reduction for breast cancer; 5.9% (0.941, 0.884 to 1.001) for lung cancer; 7.1% (0.929, 0.909 to 0.949) for colon cancer; 5.1% (0.949, 0.908 to 0.992) for gastric cancer; 17.1% (0.829, 0.760 to 0.903) for liver cancer.

Cancer survival continues to improve in high-income countries, partly explained by advances in screening and treatment. Previous studies have mainly examined the relationship between individual dietary components and cancer prognosis in tumours with good therapeutic response (breast, colon and prostate cancers). The aim of this review is to assess qualitatively (and quantitatively where appropriate) the associations of dietary patterns and cancer prognosis from published prospective cohort studies, as well as the effect of diet interventions by means of randomised controlled trials (RCT). A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, and a total of 35 prospective cohort studies and 14 RCT published between 2011 and 2021 were selected. Better overall diet quality was associated with improved survival among breast and colorectal cancer survivors; adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated to lower risk of mortality in colorectal and prostate cancer survivors. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model showed that higher versus lower diet quality was associated with a 23% reduction in overall mortality in breast cancer survivors. There was evidence that dietary interventions, generally combined with physical activity, improved overall quality of life, though most studies were in breast cancer survivors.

cancer_25651787,25651787,cancer,2015.0,"Global cancer statistics, 2012.. Cancer constitutes an enormous burden on society in more and less economically developed countries alike. The occurrence of cancer is increasing because of the growth and aging of the population, as well as an increasing prevalence of established risk factors such as smoking, overweight, physical inactivity, and changing reproductive patterns associated with urbanization and economic development. Based on GLOBOCAN estimates, about 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide. Over the years, the burden has shifted to less developed countries, which currently account for about 57% of cases and 65% of cancer deaths worldwide. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among males in both more and less developed countries, and has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among females in more developed countries; breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among females in less developed countries. Other leading causes of cancer death in more developed countries include colorectal cancer among males and females and prostate cancer among males. In less developed countries, liver and stomach cancer among males and cervical cancer among females are also leading causes of cancer death. Although incidence rates for all cancers combined are nearly twice as high in more developed than in less developed countries in both males and females, mortality rates are only 8% to 15% higher in more developed countries. This disparity reflects regional differences in the mix of cancers, which is affected by risk factors and detection practices, and/or the availability of treatment. Risk factors associated with the leading causes of cancer death include tobacco use (lung, colorectal, stomach, and liver cancer), overweight/obesity and physical inactivity (breast and colorectal cancer), and infection (liver, stomach, and cervical cancer). A substantial portion of cancer cases and deaths could be prevented by broadly applying effective prevention measures, such as tobacco control, vaccination, and the use of early detection tests.",pubmed

In the past few decades, findings from extensive epidemiologic and experimental investigations have linked consumption of several foods and nutrients to the risk of colorectal neoplasia. Calcium, fiber, milk, and whole grains have been associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer, and red meat and processed meat have been associated with an increased risk. There is substantial evidence for the potential chemopreventive effects of vitamin D, folate, fruits, and vegetables. Nutrients and foods also may interact, as a dietary pattern, to influence colorectal cancer risk. Diet likely influences colorectal carcinogenesis through several interacting mechanisms. These include the direct effects on immune responsiveness and inflammation, and the indirect effects of overnutrition and obesity-risk factors for colorectal cancer. Emerging evidence also implicates the gut microbiota as an important effector in the relationship between diet and cancer. Dietary modification therefore has the promise of reducing colorectal cancer incidence.",pubmed

The DIANA-5 randomized controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of a diet based on Mediterranean and macrobiotic traditions (macro-Mediterranean diet) in reducing breast cancer recurrence. The DIANA-5 study involved 1,542 patients with breast cancer at high risk of recurrence because of estrogen receptor-negative cancer, or metabolic syndrome, or high plasma levels of insulin or testosterone. Women were randomly assigned to an active dietary intervention (IG) or a control group (CG). Both groups received the 2007 American Institute for Cancer Research/World Cancer Research Fund recommendations for cancer prevention. The intervention consisted of meetings with kitchen classes, community meals, and dietary recommendations. Recommended foods included whole grain cereals, legumes, soy products, vegetables, fruit, nuts, olive oil, and fish. Foods to be avoided were refined products, potatoes, sugar and desserts, red and processed meat, dairy products, and alcoholic drinks. A compliance Dietary Index was defined by the difference between recommended and discouraged foods. Over the 5 years of follow-up, 95 patients of the IG and 98 of the CG developed breast cancer recurrence [HR = 0.99; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69-1.40]. The analysis by compliance to the dietary recommendations (IG and CG together) showed that the women in the upper tertile of Dietary Index change had an HR of recurrence of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.36-0.92) compared with women in the lower tertile.

Researchers have discovered associations between elements of the intestinal microbiome (including specific microbes, signaling pathways, and microbiota-related metabolites) and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is unclear whether changes in the intestinal microbiome contribute to the development of sporadic CRC or result from it. Changes in the intestinal microbiome can mediate or modify the effects of environmental factors on risk of CRC. Factors that affect risk of CRC also affect the intestinal microbiome, including overweight and obesity; physical activity; and dietary intake of fiber, whole grains, and red and processed meat. These factors alter microbiome structure and function, along with the metabolic and immune pathways that mediate CRC development. We review epidemiologic and laboratory evidence for the influence of the microbiome, diet, and environmental factors on CRC incidence and outcomes. Based on these data, features of the intestinal microbiome might be used for CRC screening and modified for chemoprevention and treatment.

cancer_26780279,26780279,cancer,2015.0,"Health Risks Associated with Meat Consumption: A Review of Epidemiological Studies.. Recent evidence from large prospective US and European cohort studies and from meta-analyses of epidemiological studies indicates that the long-term consumption of increasing amounts of red meat and particularly of processed meat is associated with an increased risk of total mortality, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes, in both men and women. The association persists after inclusion of known confounding factors, such as age, race, BMI, history, smoking, blood pressure, lipids, physical activity and multiple nutritional parameters in multivariate analysis. The association has not always been noted with red meat, and it has been absent with white meat. There is evidence of several mechanisms for the observed adverse effects that might be involved, however, their individual role is not defined at present. It is concluded that recommendations for the consumption of unprocessed red meat and particularly of processed red meat should be more restrictive than existing recommendations. Restrictive recommendations should not be applied to subjects above about 70 years of age, as the studies quoted herein did not examine this age group, and the inclusion of sufficient protein supply (e. g. in the form of meat) is particularly important in the elderly.",pubmed

In tumor-bearing mice, cyclic fasting or fasting-mimicking diets (FMD) enhance the activity of antineoplastic treatments by modulating systemic metabolism and boosting antitumor immunity. Here we conducted a clinical trial to investigate the safety and biological effects of cyclic, five-day FMD in combination with standard antitumor therapies. In 101 patients, the FMD was safe, feasible, and resulted in a consistent decrease of blood glucose and growth factor concentration, thus recapitulating metabolic changes that mediate fasting/FMD anticancer effects in preclinical experiments. Integrated transcriptomic and deep-phenotyping analyses revealed that FMD profoundly reshapes anticancer immunity by inducing the contraction of peripheral blood immunosuppressive myeloid and regulatory T-cell compartments, paralleled by enhanced intratumor Th1/cytotoxic responses and an enrichment of IFNγ and other immune signatures associated with better clinical outcomes in patients with cancer. Our findings lay the foundations for phase II/III clinical trials aimed at investigating FMD antitumor efficacy in combination with standard antineoplastic treatments. SIGNIFICANCE: Cyclic FMD is well tolerated and causes remarkable systemic metabolic changes in patients with different tumor types and treated with concomitant antitumor therapies. In addition, the FMD reshapes systemic and intratumor immunity, finally activating several antitumor immune programs. Phase II/III clinical trials are needed to investigate FMD antitumor activity/efficacy.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1</i>.",pubmed

The substantial burden of colorectal cancer and increasing trend in young adults highlight the importance of lifestyle modification as a complement to screening for colorectal cancer prevention. Several dietary and lifestyle factors have been implicated in the development of colorectal cancer, possibly through the intricate metabolic and inflammatory mechanisms. Likewise, as a key metabolic and immune regulator, the gut microbiota has been recognized to play an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis. Increasing data support that environmental factors are crucial determinants for the gut microbial composition and function, whose alterations induce changes in the host gene expression, metabolic regulation, and local and systemic immune response, thereby influencing cancer development. Here, we review the epidemiologic and mechanistic evidence regarding the links between diet and lifestyle and the gut microbiota in the development of colorectal cancer. We focus on factors for which substantial data support their importance for colorectal cancer and their potential role in the gut microbiota, including overweight and obesity, physical activity, dietary patterns, fiber, red and processed meat, marine omega-3 fatty acid, alcohol, and smoking. We also briefly describe other colorectal cancer-preventive factors for which the links with the gut microbiota have been suggested but remain to be mechanistically characterized, including vitamin D status, dairy consumption, and metformin use.

The development of colorectal cancer, responsible for 9% of cancer-related deaths, is favored by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The modification of diet and lifestyle may modify the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and prevent neoplasia in up to 50% of cases. The Western diet, characterized by a high intake of fat, red meat and processed meat has emerged as an important contributor. Conversely, a high intake of dietary fiber partially counteracts the unfavorable effects of meat through multiple mechanisms, including reduced intestinal transit time and dilution of carcinogenic compounds. Providing antioxidants (e.g., vitamins C and E) and leading to increased intraluminal production of protective fermentation products, like butyrate, represent other beneficial and useful effects of a fiber-rich diet. Protective effects on the risk of developing colorectal cancer have been also advocated for some specific micronutrients like vitamin D, selenium, and calcium. Diet-induced modifications of the gut microbiota modulate colonic epithelial cell homeostasis and carcinogenesis. This can have, under different conditions, opposite effects on the risk of CRC, through the production of mutagenic and carcinogenic agents or, conversely, of protective compounds.

Systematic review and Bayesian dose-response meta-analysis. PubMed and Embase from 1980 to 27 February 2016, and references from relevant systematic reviews. Data from the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health conducted in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa from 2007 to 2010 and the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999 to 2011 were used to map domain specific physical activity (reported in included studies) to total activity. Prospective cohort studies examining the associations between physical activity (any domain) and at least one of the five diseases studied. 174 articles were identified: 35 for breast cancer, 19 for colon cancer, 55 for diabetes, 43 for ischemic heart disease, and 26 for ischemic stroke (some articles included multiple outcomes). Although higher levels of total physical activity were significantly associated with lower risk for all outcomes, major gains occurred at lower levels of activity (up to 3000-4000 metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes/week). For example, individuals with a total activity level of 600 MET minutes/week (the minimum recommended level) had a 2% lower risk of diabetes compared with those reporting no physical activity. An increase from 600 to 3600 MET minutes/week reduced the risk by an additional 19%. The same amount of increase yielded much smaller returns at higher levels of activity: an increase of total activity from 9000 to 12 000 MET minutes/week reduced the risk of diabetes by only 0.6%. Compared with insufficiently active individuals (total activity <600 MET minutes/week), the risk reduction for those in the highly active category (≥8000 MET minutes/week) was 14% (relative risk 0.863, 95% uncertainty interval 0.829 to 0.900) for breast cancer; 21% (0.789, 0.735 to 0.850) for colon cancer; 28% (0.722, 0.678 to 0.768) for diabetes; 25% (0.754, 0.704 to 0.809) for ischemic heart disease; and 26% (0.736, 0.659 to 0.811) for ischemic stroke.

Patients with cancer other than colorectal cancer were randomly selected for control group I, and patients with no cancer diagnosis were selected for control group II. The method used was a case-control study - an observational and analytical study with a control group, conducted among patients of the Clinical Oncology Centre and the Provincial Hospital in the years 2019-2020. The study comparing the exposure was carried out in a group of people who developed the endpoint, that is colorectal cancer, with the exposure in a well-matched group of controls who did not reach the endpoint. Assessment of activity and BMI was used according to WHO recommendations, as well as the expert system. The data were tested for the distribution and the homogeneity of variance was validated before applying the parameter tests.

Physical activity is inversely associated with and sedentary behaviour is positively (and independently) associated with an increased risk of more than ten types of cancer, including colorectal cancer (and advanced adenomas), endometrial cancers, and breast cancer. The most consistent dietary risk factor for premalignant and invasive breast cancer is alcohol, whether consumed during early or late adult life, even at low levels. Epidemiological studies show that the inclusion of wholegrain, fibre, fruits, and vegetables within diets are associated with reduced cancer risk, with diet during early life (age <8 years) having the strongest apparent association with cancer incidence. However, randomised controlled trials of diet-related factors have not yet shown any conclusive associations between diet and cancer incidence. Obesity is a key contributory factor associated with cancer risk and mortality, including in dose-response associations in endometrial and post-menopausal breast cancer, and in degree and duration of fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Obesity produces an inflammatory state, characterised by macrophages clustered around enlarged hypertrophied, dead, and dying adipocytes, forming crown-like structures. Increased concentrations of aromatase and interleukin 6 in inflamed breast tissue and an increased number of macrophages, compared with healthy tissue, are also observed in women with normal body mass index, suggesting a metabolic obesity state.

A role for red and processed meat in the development of colorectal cancer has been proposed based largely on evidence from observational studies in humans, especially in those populations consuming a westernized diet. Determination of causation specifically by red or processed meat is contingent upon identification of plausible mechanisms that lead to colorectal cancer. We conducted a systematic review of the available evidence to determine the availability of plausible mechanistic data linking red and processed meat consumption to colorectal cancer risk. Forty studies using animal models or cell cultures met specified inclusion criteria, most of which were designed to examine the role of heme iron or heterocyclic amines in relation to colon carcinogenesis. Most studies used levels of meat or meat components well in excess of those found in human diets. Although many of the experiments used semi-purified diets designed to mimic the nutrient loads in current westernized diets, most did not include potential biologically active protective compounds present in whole foods. Because of these limitations in the existing literature, there is currently insufficient evidence to confirm a mechanistic link between the intake of red meat as part of a healthy dietary pattern and colorectal cancer risk. Impact statement Current recommendations to reduce colon cancer include the reduction or elimination of red or processed meats. These recommendations are based on data from epidemiological studies conducted among cultures where meat consumption is elevated and consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are reduced. This review evaluated experimental data exploring the putative mechanisms whereby red or processed meats may contribute to colon cancer. Most studies used levels of meat or meat-derived compounds that were in excess of those in human diets, even in cultures where meat intake is elevated. Experiments where protective dietary compounds were used to mitigate the extreme levels of meat and meat-derived compounds showed protection against colon cancer, with some essentially negating the impact of meat in the diet.

MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from database inception to September 2019. Only meta-analyses of prospective observational studies with a cohort study design were eligible. Evidence of association was graded according to established criteria as follows: convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or not significant. From 9954 publications, 222 full-text articles (2.2%) were evaluated for eligibility, and 45 meta-analyses (20.3%) that described 109 associations between dietary factors and CRC incidence were selected. Overall, 35 of the 109 associations (32.1%) were nominally statistically significant using random-effects meta-analysis models; 17 associations (15.6%) demonstrated large heterogeneity between studies (I2 > 50%), whereas small-study effects were found for 11 associations (10.1%). Excess significance bias was not detected for any association between diet and CRC. The primary analysis identified 5 (4.6%) convincing, 2 (1.8%) highly suggestive, 10 (9.2%) suggestive, and 18 (16.5%) weak associations between diet and CRC, while there was no evidence for 74 (67.9%) associations. There was convincing evidence of an association of intake of red meat (high vs low) and alcohol (≥4 drinks/d vs 0 or occasional drinks) with the incidence of CRC and an inverse association of higher vs lower intakes of dietary fiber, calcium, and yogurt with CRC risk. The evidence for convincing associations remained robust following sensitivity analyses. This umbrella review found convincing evidence of an association between lower CRC risk and higher intakes of dietary fiber, dietary calcium, and yogurt and lower intakes of alcohol and red meat. More research is needed on specific foods for which evidence remains suggestive, including other dairy products, whole grains, processed meat, and specific dietary patterns.",pubmed

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women, accounting for nearly 30% of all cancers, while in men, it represents only 1% of cases. Breast cancer is the main cause of death for cancer, and its incidence and mortality vary according to patients' ethnicity, geographic region, and socioeconomic status. Due to the low prevalence of breast cancer among men and the scarcity of studies in the literature, exercises have been prescribed based on extrapolations from studies on female patients. Scientific evidence has suggested beneficial effects of physical exercises on breast cancer prevention, treatment, and post-treatment. In addition to combatting sedentary behavior, it is essential to maintain a healthy body weight, limit alcohol consumption, and follow a balanced diet, rich in fruit, vegetables, grains and fibers, and limited in red meat. The effects of exercises are not restricted to breast cancer, but extend to controlling modifiable risk factors, and reducing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.",pubmed

Cancer is a multistage and multifactorial condition with genetic and environmental factors modulating tumorogenesis and disease progression. Nevertheless, cancer is preventable, as one third of cancer deaths could be avoided by modifying key risk factors. Nutrients can directly affect fundamental cellular processes and are considered among the most important risk factors in colorectal cancer (CRC). Red and processed meat, poultry consumption, fiber, and folate are the best-known diet components that interact with colorectal cancer susceptibility. In addition, the direct association of an unhealthy diet with obesity and dysbiosis opens new routes in the understanding of how daily diet nutrients could influence cancer prognosis. In the ""omics"" era, traditional nutrition has been naturally evolved to precision nutrition where technical developments have contributed to a more accurate discipline. In this sense, genomic and transcriptomic studies have been extensively used in precision nutrition approaches. However, the relation between CRC carcinogenesis and nutrition factors is more complex than originally expected. Together with classical diet-nutrition-related genes, nowadays, lipid-metabolism-related genes have acquired relevant interest in precision nutrition studies. Lipids regulate very diverse cellular processes from ATP synthesis and the activation of essential cell-signaling pathways to membrane organization and plasticity. Therefore, a wide range of tumorogenic steps can be influenced by lipid metabolism, both in primary tumours and distal metastasis. The extent to which genetic variants, together with the intake of specific dietary components, affect the risk of CRC is currently under investigation, and new therapeutic or preventive applications must be explored in CRC models. In this review, we will go in depth into the study of co-occurring events, which orchestrate CRC tumorogenesis and are essential for the evolution of precision nutrition paradigms. Likewise, we will discuss the application of precision nutrition approaches to target lipid metabolism in CRC.",pubmed

Inverse linear associations were observed for vegetables (RR per 100 g/d, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99), fruit (RR per 100 g/d, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99), cheese (RR per 30 g/d, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-1.00), and soy (RR per 30 g/d, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99), while positive associations were observed for red (RR per 100 g/d, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.18) and processed meat (RR per 50 g/d, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04-1.33). None of the other food groups were significantly associated with breast cancer risk. A nonlinear association was observed only for milk, such that the intake of >450 g/d increased the risk, while no association was observed for lower intake amounts. High intakes of vegetables, fruit, cheese, and soy products and low intakes of red and processed meat were associated with lower risks of breast cancer.

This meta-analysis aims to quantify the relationship between red and processed meat intake and the risk of CRC, colon cancer, and rectal cancer using the most comprehensive set of prospective studies to date. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Google Scholar databases from 1990 to November 2024, to identify relevant prospective studies examining red, processed, and total meat consumption in relation to colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer risk. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted for each study and pooled using a random-effects model to account for variability among studies. Statistical evaluation was executed using the online platform MetaAnalysisOnline.com. A total of 60 prospective studies were included. Red meat consumption was associated with a significantly increased risk of colon cancer (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.15-1.30), colorectal cancer (HR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.10-1.21), and rectal cancer (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.39).

Aberrant energy status contributes to multiple metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that ketogenic-diet-induced changes in energy status enhance the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy by decreasing PD-L1 protein levels and increasing expression of type-I interferon (IFN) and antigen presentation genes. Mechanistically, energy deprivation activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn, phosphorylates PD-L1 on Ser283, thereby disrupting its interaction with CMTM4 and subsequently triggering PD-L1 degradation. In addition, AMPK phosphorylates EZH2, which disrupts PRC2 function, leading to enhanced IFNs and antigen presentation gene expression. Through these mechanisms, AMPK agonists or ketogenic diets enhance the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy and improve the overall survival rate in syngeneic mouse tumor models. Our findings reveal a pivotal role for AMPK in regulating the immune response to immune-checkpoint blockade and advocate for combining ketogenic diets or AMPK agonists with anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy to combat cancer.",pubmed

Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk is strongly affected by dietary habits with red and processed meat increasing risk, and foods rich in dietary fibres considered protective. Dietary habits also shape gut microbiota, but the role of the combination between diet, the gut microbiota, and the metabolite profile on CRC risk is still missing an unequivocal characterisation. To investigate how gut microbiota affects diet-associated CRC risk, we fed Apc-mutated PIRC rats and azoxymethane (AOM)-induced rats the following diets: a high-risk red/processed meat-based diet (MBD), a normalised risk diet (MBD with α-tocopherol, MBDT), a low-risk pesco-vegetarian diet (PVD), and control diet. We then conducted faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from PIRC rats to germ-free rats treated with AOM and fed a standard diet for 3 months. We analysed multiple tumour markers and assessed the variations in the faecal microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing together with targeted- and untargeted-metabolomics analyses. In both animal models, the PVD group exhibited significantly lower colon tumorigenesis than the MBD ones, consistent with various CRC biomarkers. Faecal microbiota and its metabolites also revealed significant diet-dependent profiles. Intriguingly, when faeces from PIRC rats fed these diets were transplanted into germ-free rats, those transplanted with MBD faeces developed a higher number of preneoplastic lesions together with distinctive diet-related bacterial and metabolic profiles. PVD determines a selection of nine taxonomic markers mainly belonging to Lachnospiraceae and Prevotellaceae families exclusively associated with at least two different animal models, and within these, four taxonomic markers were shared across all the three animal models. An inverse correlation between nonconjugated bile acids and bacterial genera mainly belonging to the Lachnospiraceae and Prevotellaceae families (representative of the PVD group) was present, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for the protective effect of these genera against CRC. These results highlight the protective effects of PVD while reaffirming the carcinogenic properties of MBD diets. In germ-free rats, FMT induced changes reminiscent of dietary effects, including heightened preneoplastic lesions in MBD rats and the transmission of specific diet-related bacterial and metabolic profiles. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that diet-associated cancer risk can be transferred with faeces, establishing gut microbiota as a determinant of diet-associated CRC risk. Therefore, this study marks the pioneering demonstration of faecal transfer as a means of conveying diet-related cancer risk, firmly establishing the gut microbiota as a pivotal factor in diet-associated CRC susceptibility.

The lack of positive intervention trials and limited mechanistic understanding likely explain limited public health impact of epidemiological observations, to date. An alternative strategy for nutritional prevention of CRC is use of supplements that provide higher individual nutrient exposure than obtained through the diet (chemoprevention).

Several mechanisms for mutagenic effects of meat consumption have been identified but it is not clear which cause cancer in humans. The extent to which complete abstention from meat protects against cancer is also uncertain.

We hypothesized that the association of the Western-style diet (rich in red and processed meat) with colorectal cancer incidence might be stronger for tumors containing higher amounts of pks<sup>+</sup>E coli. Western diet score was calculated using food frequency questionnaire data obtained every 4 years during follow-up of 134,775 participants in 2 United States-wide prospective cohort studies. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we measured pks<sup>+</sup>E coli DNA in 1175 tumors among 3200 incident colorectal cancer cases that had occurred during the follow-up. We used the 3200 cases and inverse probability weighting (to adjust for selection bias due to tissue availability), integrated in multivariable-adjusted duplication-method Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. The association of the Western diet score with colorectal cancer incidence was stronger for tumors containing higher levels of pks<sup>+</sup>E coli (P<sub>heterogeneity</sub> = .014). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence interval) for the highest (vs lowest) tertile of the Western diet score were 3.45 (1.53-7.78) (P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.001) for pks<sup>+</sup>E coli-high tumors, 1.22 (0.57-2.63) for pks<sup>+</sup>E coli-low tumors, and 1.10 (0.85-1.42) for pks<sup>+</sup>E coli-negative tumors. The pks<sup>+</sup>E coli level was associated with lower disease stage but not with tumor location, microsatellite instability, or BRAF, KRAS, or PIK3CA mutations.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence changes with time and by variations in diet and lifestyle, as evidenced historically by migrant studies and recently by extensive epidemiologic evidence. The worldwide heterogeneity in CRC incidence is strongly suggestive of etiological involvement of environmental exposures, particularly lifestyle and diet. It is established that physical inactivity, obesity and some dietary factors (red/processed meats, alcohol) are positively associated with CRC, while healthy lifestyle habits show inverse associations. Mechanistic evidence shows that lifestyle and dietary components that contribute to energy excess are linked with increased CRC via metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, bacterial dysbiosis and breakdown of gut barrier integrity while the reverse is apparent for components associated with decreased risk. This chapter will review the available evidence on lifestyle and dietary factors in CRC etiology and their underlying mechanisms in CRC development.

Scientific evidence has shown that an increase in regular physical activity is associated with a decrease in the development of many types of cancer. Potential mechanisms that link physical activity to reduced cancer risk include a decrease in systemic inflammation, hyperinsulinemia, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), sex hormones, pro-inflammatory leptin and other obesity-related cytokines, and a significant increase in anti-inflammatory adiponectin levels. In addition, physical activity improves immune function and the composition and diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiota. Moderate physical activity is important for cancer protection, but the most significant changes in the inflammatory profile are conferred by physical activity performed at higher intensities. Thus, there is a need for further investigation into the type, intensity, and duration of physical activity for the prevention of some types of cancer and the development of effective recommendations.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cancer in incidence and the second leading cancer in mortality worldwide. There is growing scientific evidence to support the crucial role of the gut microbiota in the development of CRC. The gut microbiota is the complex community of microorganisms that inhabit the host gut in a symbiotic relationship. Diet plays a crucial role in modulating the risk of CRC, with a high intake of red and processed meat being a risk factor for the development of CRC. The production of metabolites derived from protein fermentation by the gut microbiota is considered a crucial element in the interaction between red and processed meat consumption and the development of CRC. This paper examines several metabolites derived from the bacterial fermentation of proteins associated with an increased risk of CRC. These metabolites include ammonia, polyamines, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), N-nitroso compounds (NOC), hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S), phenolic compounds (p-cresol) and indole compounds (indolimines). These compounds are depicted and reviewed for their association with CRC risk, possible mechanisms promoting carcinogenesis and their relationship with the gut microbiota.

Whether bariatric surgery influences the risk of obesity-related cancer is not clear. This study aimed to uncover the risk of hormone-related (breast, endometrial and prostate), colorectal and oesophageal cancers following obesity surgery. This national population-based cohort study used data from the Hospital Episode Statistics database in England collected between 1997 and 2012. Propensity matching on sex, age, co-morbidity and duration of follow-up was used to compare cancer risk among obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery (gastric bypass, gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy) and obese individuals not undergoing such surgery. Conditional logistic regression provided odds ratios (ORs) with 95 per cent confidence intervals. In the study period, from a cohort of 716 960 patients diagnosed with obesity, 8794 patients who underwent bariatric surgery were matched exactly with 8794 obese patients who did not have surgery. Compared with the no-surgery group, patients who had bariatric surgery exhibited a decreased risk of hormone-related cancers (OR 0·23, 95 per cent c.i. 0·18 to 0·30). This decrease was consistent for breast (OR 0·25, 0·19 to 0·33), endometrium (OR 0·21, 0·13 to 0·35) and prostate (OR 0·37, 0·17 to 0·76) cancer. Gastric bypass resulted in the largest risk reduction for hormone-related cancers (OR 0·16, 0·11 to 0·24). Gastric bypass, but not gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy, was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR 2·63, 1·17 to 5·95). Longer follow-up after bariatric surgery strengthened these diverging associations.

This review summarizes the evidence regarding physical activity and diet after colorectal cancer diagnosis in relation to quality of life, disease recurrence, and survival. There have been extensive reports on adiposity, inactivity, and certain diets, particularly those high in red and processed meats, and increased risk of colorectal cancer. Only in the past decade have data emerged on how such lifestyle factors are associated with outcomes in colorectal cancer survivors. Prospective observational studies have consistently reported that physical activity after colorectal cancer diagnosis reduces mortality. A meta-analysis estimated that each 15 metabolic equivalent task-hour per week increase in physical activity after colorectal cancer diagnosis was associated with a 38% lower risk of mortality. No randomized controlled trials have been completed to confirm that physical activity lowers risk of mortality among colorectal cancer survivors; however, trials have shown that physical activity, including structured exercise, is safe for colorectal cancer survivors (localized to metastatic stage, during and after treatment) and improves cardiorespiratory fitness and physical function. In addition, prospective observational studies have suggested that a Western dietary pattern, high carbohydrate intake, and consuming sugar-sweetened beverages after diagnosis may increase risk of colorectal cancer recurrence and mortality, but these data are limited to single analyses from one of two US cohorts. Additional data from prospective studies and randomized controlled trials are needed. Nonetheless, on the basis of the available evidence, it is reasonable to counsel colorectal cancer survivors to engage in regular physical activity and limit consumption of refined carbohydrates, red and processed meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages.",pubmed

Effects of confounders on associations between diet and colorectal cancer (CRC) in observational studies can be minimized in Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. This study aimed to investigate observational and genetically predicted associations between dietary intake and CRC using one-sample MR. Using genetic data of over 93 million variants, we performed a genome-wide association study to find genomic risk loci associated with dietary intake in participants from the UK Biobank. Then we calculated genetic risk scores of diet-related variants and used them as instrumental variables in the two-stage least square MR framework to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations. We also performed observational analyses using age as a time-scale in Cox proportional hazard models. Allele scores were calculated from 399 genetic variants associated with the consumption of of red meat, processed meat, poultry, fish, milk, cheese, fruits, vegetables, coffee, tea, and alcohol in participants from the UK Biobank. In MR analysis, genetically predicted fruit intake was significantly associated with a 21% decreased risk of CRC (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.66-0.95), and there was a marginally inverse association between vegetable intake and CRC (HR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.71-1.02).

For CRC, 28 preclinical and 9 clinical studies were selected in line with our search query in science databases. In relation to BC, 14 preclinical and 5 clinical studies were selected. Remarkably, all the preclinical studies, to a greater or lesser degree, suggested a chemoprevention effect of anthocyanin in BC/CRC rodent models. These encouraging results from animal models are not extrapolated to the same degree to human studies where, from the similar theoretical daily doses of anthocyanins in these studies, the opposite results were reported. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the anthocyanin doses in the human studies carried out recently are low if we consider the estimated exposure to anthocyanins issued by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) or extremely low if we consider with caution the human equivalent dose based on body surface area from the preclinical dosage regimes used. Therefore, although some clinical data has demonstrated an inverse relation between anthocyanin consumption and BC/CRC, this could, in fact, be more relevant if we increase the daily human anthocyanin dose (as observed in animal model dose-effect studies) while new toxicological data for this flavonoid subtype are brought to light.",pubmed

The lack of physical activity, smoking habits, and a diet high in red meat and fat and low in fiber are important aspects of these deleterious changes in lifestyle. The increase in the incidence of CRC has impelled researchers to investigate methods for preventing and treating CRC with greater efficacy and fewer complications. Probiotics are an attractive and potentially promising therapeutic approach. They have been evaluated by a large number of preclinical and clinical studies in recent years, and it has been found that they can play a role in the prevention, treatment, and management of complications of CRC.

PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane library databases were searched systematically for eligible studies that investigated the relation between meat consumption and the risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers, including esophageal cancer (EC), gastric cancer (GC), colorectal cancer (CRC), colon cancer (CC), rectal cancer (RC), pancreatic cancer (PC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) throughout February, 2023. The pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was assigned as an effect estimate and calculated using a random-effects model with inverse variance weighting. Forty cohorts comprising 3,780,590 individuals were selected for the final quantitative analysis. The summary results indicated that a higher red meat consumption was associated with an increased risk of CRC (RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.02-1.16; P = 0.007) and CC (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.03-1.25; P = 0.011).

Changes in dietary habits were defined as stable poor, poor to good, good to poor, and stable to good adherences. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the association between dietary changes and colorectal cancer risk. Women were more likely to follow dietary recommendations than men.

Data came from a multicentric Italian case-control study including 1,953 histologically confirmed colorectal cancer cases and 4,154 hospital controls admitted for acute nonneoplastic diseases. Diet was assessed through a validated and reproducible food frequency questionnaire. The DRRD score was computed assigning higher values for higher consumption of cereal fiber, fruit, coffee, nuts and a higher polyunsaturated/saturated fats ratio and for lower glycemic index and lower consumption of red/processed meat and sweetened beverages and fruit juices. The ORs and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of colorectal cancer according to the DRRD score were obtained using logistic regression models adjusting for total energy intake and other major confounders. The DRRD was inversely related to colorectal cancer risk. The ORs of colorectal cancer were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.67-0.89) for the third versus first score tertile (Ptrend < 0.001) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87-0.96) for a 3-point increment in the score. Inverse associations were observed for colon and rectal cancers and were consistent in strata of sex, age, and other major covariates.

This hypothesis-generating analysis used biospecimens collected from a multi-centre 2 × 2 factorial randomized design of 116 patients with stage I-III breast and colorectal cancer who were randomized to 12 weeks of (1) aerobic exercise (moderate intensity titrated to 220 min/week); (2) metformin (850 mg daily for 2 weeks and then titrated to 850 mg twice per day); (3) aerobic exercise and metformin; or (4) control. Fourteen myokines were quantified using a multiplex panel. Myokine concentrations were log-transformed, and main effects analyses were conducted using linear mixed-effects regression models. The type I error rate was controlled with the Holm sequential testing procedure. Randomization to exercise increased leukaemia inhibitory factor (1.26 pg/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69, 1.84; adjusted P = 0.001) and interleukin-15 (2.23 pg/mL, 95% CI: 0.87, 3.60; adjusted P = 0.013) compared with randomization to no exercise.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2 gene Pro12Ala allele polymorphism (<i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala; rs1801282) has been linked to both cancer risk and dietary factors. We conducted the first systematic literature review of studies published before December 2020 using the PubMed database to summarize the current evidence on whether dietary factors for cancer may differ by individuals carrying C (common) and/or G (minor) alleles of the <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism. The inclusion criteria were observational studies that investigated the association between food or nutrient consumption and risk of incident cancer stratified by <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism. From 3815 identified abstracts, nine articles (18,268 participants and 4780 cancer cases) covering three cancer sites (i.e., colon/rectum, prostate, and breast) were included. CG/GG allele carriers were more impacted by dietary factors than CC allele carriers. High levels of protective factors (e.g., carotenoids and prudent dietary patterns) were associated with a lower cancer risk, and high levels of risk factors (e.g., alcohol and refined grains) were associated with a higher cancer risk. In contrast, both CG/GG and CC allele carriers were similarly impacted by dietary fats, well-known PPAR-γ agonists. These findings highlight the complex relation between <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism, dietary factors, and cancer risk, which warrant further investigation.",pubmed

The potential relationship between red meat consumption and colorectal cancer (CRC) has been the subject of scientific debate. Given the high degree of resulting uncertainty, our objective was to update the state of the science by conducting a systematic quantitative assessment of the epidemiologic literature. Specifically, we updated and expanded our previous meta-analysis by integrating data from new prospective cohort studies and conducting a broader evaluation of the relative risk estimates by specific intake categories. Data from 27 independent prospective cohort studies were meta-analyzed using random-effects models, and sources of potential heterogeneity were examined through subgroup and sensitivity analyses. In addition, a comprehensive evaluation of potential dose-response patterns was conducted. In the meta-analysis of all cohorts, a weakly elevated summary relative risk was observed (1.11, 95% CI: 1.03-1.19); however, statistically significant heterogeneity was present. In general, summary associations were attenuated (closer to the null and less heterogeneous) in models that isolated fresh red meat (from processed meat), adjusted for more relevant factors, analyzed women only, and were conducted in countries outside of the United States. Furthermore, no clear patterns of dose-response were apparent. In conclusion, the state of the epidemiologic science on red meat consumption and CRC is best described in terms of weak associations, heterogeneity, an inability to disentangle effects from other dietary and lifestyle factors, lack of a clear dose-response effect, and weakening evidence over time. KEY TEACHING POINTS: •The role of red meat consumption in colorectal cancer risk has been widely contested among the scientific community.•In the current meta-analysis of red meat intake and colorectal cancer, we comprehensively examined associations by creating numerous sub-group stratifications, conducting extensive sensitivity analyses, and evaluating dose-response using several different methods.•Overall, all summary associations were weak in magnitude with no clear dose-response patterns.•Interpretation of findings from epidemiologic studies investigating diet and health outcomes involves numerous methodological considerations, such as accurately measuring food intake, dietary pattern differences across populations, food definitions, outcome classifications, bias and confounding, multicollinearity, biological mechanisms, genetic variation in metabolizing enzymes, and differences in analytical metrics and statistical testing parameters.",pubmed

Whole grain and fiber intakes may decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. The interplay between host genetic factors, colonization of specific bacteria, production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and intake of whole grains and fiber could alter the protective role of carbohydrates against colorectal cancer. Here, we assessed intakes of types and sources of carbohydrates in 114,217 UK Biobank participants with detailed dietary data (2-5 24-hour dietary assessments), and a host polygenic score (PGS) was applied to categorize participants as high or low for intraluminal microbial SCFA production, namely, butyrate and propionate. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the associations of carbohydrates and SCFA with colorectal cancer incidence. During a median follow-up of 9.4 years, 1,193 participants were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Risk was inversely associated with intakes of non-free sugar and whole grain fiber. Evidence of heterogeneity was observed by the butyrate PGS; consuming higher amounts of whole grain starch was only associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in those with predicted high SCFA production. Similarly, in additional analyses utilizing the larger UK Biobank cohort (N = 343,621) with less detailed dietary assessment, only individuals with a high genetically predicted butyrate production had a lower risk of colorectal cancer per 5 g/day intake of bread and cereal fiber. This study suggests that colorectal cancer risk varies by intake of carbohydrate types and sources, and the impact of whole grain intake may be modified by SCFA production. Prospective population-level analyses provide evidence supporting the importance of butyrate production in reduction of colorectal cancer risk by whole grain consumption.",pubmed

Studies were systematically searched in Pubmed and EMBASE electronic databases. Eligible studies had a prospective design and compared vegetarian, semi- and pesco-vegetarian diets with a non-vegetarian diet. Random-effects models were applied to calculate relative risks (RRs) of cancer between diets. Statistical heterogeneity and publication bias were explored. A total of nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. Studies were conducted on six cohorts accounting for 686 629 individuals, and 3441, 4062 and 1935 cases of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer, respectively. None of the analyses showed a significant association of vegetarian diet and a lower risk of either breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer compared to a non-vegetarian diet.

A prospective interventional study evaluated nonadherence prevalence and preference for cancer screening among hospitalized women aged 50 to 75 years. The intervention consisted of one-to-one bedside education via handouts about cancer screening. In addition, multivariable logistic regression models assessed associations between sociodemographic and clinical comorbidity variables believed to influence screening adherence among hospitalized women. Six months after discharge from the hospital, study participants received a follow-up telephone survey to determine adherence to BRC/CRC screening guidelines.

Epidemiology and experimental studies provide an overwhelming support of the notion that diets high in red or processed meat accompany an elevated risk of developing pre-neoplastic colorectal adenoma and frank colorectal carcinoma (CRC). The underlying mechanisms are disputed; thus several hypotheses have been proposed. A large body of reports converges, however, on haem and nitrosyl haem as major contributors to the CRC development, presumably acting through various mechanisms. Apart from a potentially higher intestinal mutagenic load among consumers on a diet rich in red/processed meat, other mechanisms involving subtle interference with colorectal stem/progenitor cell survival or maturation are likewise at play. From an overarching perspective, suggested candidate mechanisms for red/processed meat-induced CRC appear as three partly overlapping tenets: (i) increased N-nitrosation/oxidative load leading to DNA adducts and lipid peroxidation in the intestinal epithelium, (ii) proliferative stimulation of the epithelium through haem or food-derived metabolites that either act directly or subsequent to conversion, and (iii) higher inflammatory response, which may trigger a wide cascade of pro-malignant processes.

Among all racial/ethnic groups, people who identify as African American/Blacks have the second highest colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence in the USA. This disparity may exist because African American/Blacks, compared to other racial/ethnic groups, have a higher prevalence of risk factors for CRC, including obesity, low fiber consumption, and higher intakes of fat and animal protein. One unexplored, underlying mechanism of this relationship is the bile acid-gut microbiome axis. High saturated fat, low fiber diets, and obesity lead to increases in tumor promoting secondary bile acids. Diets high in fiber, such as a Mediterranean diet, and intentional weight loss may reduce CRC risk by modulating the bile acid-gut microbiome axis. The purpose of this study is to test the impact of a Mediterranean diet alone, weight loss alone, or both, compared to typical diet controls on the bile acid-gut microbiome axis and CRC risk factors among African American/Blacks with obesity. Because weight loss or a Mediterranean diet alone can reduce CRC risk, we hypothesize that weight loss plus a Mediterranean diet will reduce CRC risk the most. This randomized controlled lifestyle intervention will randomize 192 African American/Blacks with obesity, aged 45-75 years to one of four arms: Mediterranean diet, weight loss, weight loss plus Mediterranean diet, or typical diet controls, for 6 months (48 per arm). Data will be collected at baseline, mid-study, and study end. Primary outcomes include total circulating and fecal bile acids, taurine-conjugated bile acids, and deoxycholic acid. Secondary outcomes include body weight, body composition, dietary change, physical activity, metabolic risk, circulating cytokines, gut microbial community structure and composition, fecal short-chain fatty acids, and expression levels of genes from exfoliated intestinal cells linked to carcinogenesis. This study will be the first randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of a Mediterranean diet, weight loss, or both on bile acid metabolism, the gut microbiome, and intestinal epithelial genes associated with carcinogenesis.

We set out to review the scientific evidence to study the need to investigate the role of the <i>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α)</i> gene as a biomarker of the physical activity's (PA) effect on colorectal cancer. PA is a protective factor against colorectal cancer and usually increases the expression of <i>PGC-1α</i> This gene has pleiotropic roles and is the main regulator of mitochondrial functions. The development of colorectal cancer has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction; in addition, alterations in this organelle are associated with colorectal cancer risk factors, such as obesity, decreased muscle mass, and the aging process. These are affected by PA acting, among other aspects, on insulin sensitivity and oxygen reactive species/redox balance. Therefore, this gene demands special attention in the understanding of its operation in the consensual protective effect of PA in colorectal cancer. A significant amount of indirect evidence points to PGC-1α as a potential biomarker in the PA-protective effect on colorectal cancer. The article focuses on the possible involvement of <i>PGC-1α</i> in the protective role that physical activity has on colorectal cancer. This is an important topic both in relation to advances in prevention of the development of this widespread disease and in its therapeutic treatment. We hope to generate an initial hypothesis for future studies associated with physical activity-related mechanisms that may be involved in the development or prevention of colorectal cancer. <i>PGC-1α</i> is highlighted because it is the main regulator of mitochondrial functions. This organelle, on one hand, is positively stimulated by physical activity; on the other hand, its dysfunction or reduction increases the probability of developing colorectal cancer. Therefore, we consider the compilation of existing information about the possible ways to understand the mechanisms of this gene to be highly relevant.

High consumption of processed meat and unprocessed red meat is associated with increased risk of multiple chronic diseases, although there is substantial uncertainty regarding the relationship for unprocessed red meat. We developed a microsimulation model to estimate how reductions in processed meat and unprocessed red meat consumption could affect rates of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, and mortality in the US adult population. We used data from two versions of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, one conducted during 2015-16 and one conducted during 2017-18, to create a simulated US population. The starting cohort was restricted to respondents aged 18 years or older who were not pregnant and had 2 days of dietary-recall data. First, we used previously developed risk models to estimate the baseline disease risk of an individual. For type 2 diabetes we used a logistic-regression model and for cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer we used Cox proportional-hazard models. We then multiplied baseline risk by relative risk associated with individual processed meat and unprocessed red meat consumption. Prevented occurrences of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, and mortality were computed by taking the difference between the incidence in the baseline and intervention scenarios. All stages were repeated for ten iterations to correspond to a 10-year time span. Scenarios were reductions of 5%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 75%, and 100% in grams consumed of processed meat, unprocessed red meat, or both. Each scenario was repeated 50 times for uncertainty analysis. The total number of individual respondents included in the simulated population was 8665, representing 242 021 876 US adults. 4493 (51·9%) of 8665 individuals were female and 4172 (48·1%) were male; mean age was 49·54 years (SD 18·38). At baseline, weighted mean daily consumption of processed meat was 29·1 g, with a 30% reduction being 8·7 g per day, and of unprocessed red meat was 46·7 g, with a 30% reduction being 14·0 g per day. We estimated that a 30% reduction in processed meat intake alone could lead to 352 900 (95% uncertainty interval 345 500-359 900) fewer occurrences of type 2 diabetes, 92 500 (85 600-99 900) fewer occurrences of cardiovascular disease, 53 300 (51 400-55 000) fewer occurrences of colorectal cancer, and 16 700 (15 300-17 700) fewer all-cause deaths during the 10-year period. A 30% reduction in unprocessed red meat intake alone could lead to 732 600 (725 700-740 400) fewer occurrences of type 2 diabetes, 291 500 (283 900-298 800) fewer occurrences of cardiovascular disease, 32 200 (31 500-32 700) fewer occurrences of colorectal cancer, and 46 100 (45 300-47 200) fewer all-cause deaths during the 10-year period.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence increases yearly, and is three to four times higher in developed countries compared to developing countries. The well-known risk factors have been attributed to low physical activity, overweight, obesity, dietary consumption including excessive consumption of red processed meats, alcohol, and low dietary fiber content. There is growing evidence of the interplay between diet and gut microbiota in CRC carcinogenesis. Although there appears to be a direct causal role for gut microbes in the development of CRC in some animal models, the link between diet, gut microbes, and colonic carcinogenesis has been established largely as an association rather than as a cause-and-effect relationship. This is especially true for human studies. As essential dietary factors influence CRC risk, the role of proteins, carbohydrates, fat, and their end products are considered as part of the interplay between diet and gut microbiota. The underlying molecular mechanisms of colon carcinogenesis mediated by gut microbiota are also discussed. Human biological responses such as inflammation, oxidative stress, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage can all influence dysbiosis and consequently CRC carcinogenesis. Dysbiosis could add to CRC risk by shifting the effect of dietary components toward promoting a colonic neoplasm together with interacting with gut microbiota. It follows that dietary intervention and gut microbiota modulation may play a vital role in reducing CRC risk.",pubmed

A total of 53,269 participants aged 30-79 years were derived from the Wuzhong subcohort of the China Kadoorie Biobank study during 2004-2008. We included 52,938 cancer-free participants in the final analysis. Incident cancers were identified through linkage with the health insurance system and death registries. Cox proportional hazard models were introduced to assess the associations of total daily physical activity with the incidence of 6 common types of cancer. During a follow-up of 10.1 years, 3,674 cases of cancer were identified, including 794 (21.6%) from stomach cancer, 722 (19.7%) from lung cancer, 458 (12.5%) from colorectal cancer, 338 (9.2%) from liver cancer, 250 (6.8%) from breast cancer, and 231 (6.3%) from oesophageal cancer. Compared to the participants in the lowest quartile of physical activity levels, those in the highest quartile had an 11% lower risk for total cancer incidence (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81-0.99), 25% lower risk for lung cancer incidence (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.60-0.94), and 26% lower risk for colorectal cancer incidence (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55-1.00). There were significant interactions of physical activity with sex and smoking on total cancer (both P for interaction < 0.005), showing a lower risk for females and never smokers (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87-0.98 and HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.87-0.98, respectively). Higher physical activity levels are associated with a reduced risk of total, lung, and colorectal cancer.",pubmed

High red and processed meat intake (RPMI) is an established risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). We aimed to assess the impact of RPMI on CRC risk according to and in comparison with genetically determined risk, which was quantified by a polygenic risk score (PRS). RPMI and potential confounders (ascertained by questionnaire) and a PRS (based on 140 CRC-related loci) were obtained from 5109 CRC cases and 4134 controls in a population-based case−control study. Associations of RPMI with CRC risk across PRS levels were assessed using logistic regression models and compared to effect estimates of PRS using “genetic risk equivalent” (GRE), a novel metric for effective risk communication. RPMI multiple times/week, 1 time/day, and >1 time/day was associated with 19% (95% CI 1% to 41%), 41% (18% to 70%), and 73% (30% to 132%) increased CRC risk, respectively, when compared to RPMI ≤ 1 time/week. Associations were independent of PRS levels (pinteraction = 0.97). The effect of RPMI > 1 time/day was equivalent to the effect of having 42 percentiles higher PRS level (GRE 42, 95% CI 20−65). RPMI increases CRC risk regardless of PRS levels. Avoiding RPMI can compensate for a substantial proportion of polygenic risk for CRC.",pubmed

Post-treatment management is essential for improving the health and quality of life of colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. The number of cancer survivors is continually increasing, which is causing a corresponding growth in the need for effective post-treatment management programs. Current research on the topic indicates that such programs should include aspects such as physical activity and a proper diet, which would form the basis of lifestyle change among CRC survivors. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the impact of physical activity and diet on the quality of life of CRC survivors. We performed a systematic literature review regarding CRC survivors. We searched the Embase, PubMed, and EBSCOhost databases, considering papers published between January 2000 and May 2017 in any language, using a combination of the following subject headings: ""colorectal cancer,"" ""colorectal carcinoma survivor,"" ""survivorship plan,"" ""survivorship care plan,"" ""survivorship program,"" ""lifestyle,"" ""activities,"" ""exercise,"" ""diet program,"" and ""nutrition."" A total of 14,036 articles were identified, with 35 satisfying the eligibility criteria for the systematic review. These articles were grouped by the study questions into physical activity and diet: 24 articles were included in the physical activity group and 11 in the diet group. The research showed that an effective survivorship program can significantly help CRC survivors maintain good health and quality of life for long periods. However, there is a lack of consensus and conclusive evidence regarding how the guidelines for such a program should be designed, in terms of both its form and content.",pubmed

We evaluated individual grain-containing foods and whole and refined grain intake during adolescence, early adulthood, and premenopausal years in relation to breast cancer risk in the Nurses' Health Study II. Grain-containing food intakes were reported on a baseline dietary questionnaire (1991) and every 4 years thereafter. Among 90,516 premenopausal women aged 27-44 years, we prospectively identified 3235 invasive breast cancer cases during follow-up to 2013. 44,263 women reported their diet during high school, and from 1998 to 2013, 1347 breast cancer cases were identified among these women. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) of breast cancer for individual, whole and refined grain foods. After adjusting for known breast cancer risk factors, adult intake of whole grain foods was associated with lower premenopausal breast cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quintile: RR 0.82; 95 % CI 0.70-0.97; P trend = 0.03), but not postmenopausal breast cancer. This association was no longer significant after further adjustment for fiber intake. The average of adolescent and early adulthood whole grain food intake was suggestively associated with lower premenopausal breast cancer risk (highest vs lowest quintile: RR 0.74; 95 % CI 0.56-0.99; P trend = 0.09). Total refined grain food intake was not associated with risk of breast cancer. Most individual grain-containing foods were not associated with breast cancer risk. The exceptions were adult brown rice which was associated with lower risk of overall and premenopausal breast cancer (for each 2 servings/week: RR 0.94; 95 % CI 0.89-0.99 and RR 0.91; 95 % CI 0.85-0.99, respectively) and adult white bread intake which was associated with increased overall breast cancer risk (for each 2 servings/week: RR 1.02; 95 % CI 1.01-1.04), as well as breast cancer before and after menopause. Further, pasta intake was inversely associated with overall breast cancer risk. Our results suggest that high whole grain food intake may be associated with lower breast cancer risk before menopause.

Existing evidence suggests a link between the inflammatory potential of diet and risk of cancer. This study aimed to test the linear and potential nonlinear dose-response associations of the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), as being representative of inflammatory features of the diet, and site-specific cancer risk. A systematic search was conducted with the use of PubMed and Scopus from 2014 to November 2017. Prospective cohort or case-control studies reporting the risk estimates of any cancer type for ≥3 categories of the DII were selected. Studies that reported the association between continuous DII score and cancer risk were also included. Pooled RRs were calculated by using a random-effects model. Eleven prospective cohort studies (total n = 1,187,474) with 28,614 incident cases and 29 case-control studies with 19,718 cases and 33,229 controls were identified. The pooled RRs for a 1-unit increment in the DII were as follows: colorectal cancer, 1.06 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.08; I2 = 72.5%; n = 9); breast cancer, 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.07; I2 = 84.0%; n = 7); prostate cancer, 1.06 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.15; I2 = 56.2%; n = 6); pancreatic cancer, 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.28; I2 = 61.6%; n = 2); ovarian cancer, 1.08 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.13; I2 = 0%; n = 2); esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 1.24 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.38; I2 = 64.3%; n = 2); renal cell carcinoma, 1.08 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.13; I2 = 0%; n = 2); and esophageal adenocarcinoma, 1.26 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.39; I2 = 0%; n = 2). A nonlinear dose-response meta-analysis showed that, after a somewhat unchanged risk within initial scores of the DII, the risk of colorectal cancer increased linearly with increasing DII score. In the analyses of breast and prostate cancers, the risk increased with a very slight trend with increasing DII score.

Despite the success of colonoscopy screening and recent advances in cancer treatment, colorectal cancer (CRC) still remains one of the most commonly diagnosed and deadly cancers, with a significantly increased incidence in developing countries where people are adapting to Western lifestyle. Diet has an important impact on risk of CRC. Multiple epidemiological studies have suggested that excessive animal protein and fat intake, especially red meat and processed meat, could increase the risk of developing CRC while fiber could protect against colorectal tumorigenesis. Mechanisms have been investigated by animal studies. Diet could re-shape the community structure of gut microbiota and influence its function by modulating the production of metabolites. Butyrate, one of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which act as a favorable source for colonocytes, could protect colonic epithelial cells from tumorigenesis via anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic properties through cell metabolism, microbiota homeostasis, antiproliferative, immunomodulatory and genetic/epigenetic regulation ways. In contrast, protein fermentation and bile acid deconjugation, which cause damage to colonic cells through proinflammatory and proneoplastic ways, lead to increased risk of developing CRC. In conclusion, a balanced diet with an increased abundance of fiber should be adopted to reduce the risk and prevent CRC.",pubmed

The breast is particularly vulnerable to carcinogenic influences during adolescence due to rapid proliferation of mammary cells and lack of terminal differentiation. We investigated consumption of adolescent red meat and other protein sources in relation to breast cancer risk in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. We followed prospectively 44,231 women aged 33-52 years who, in 1998, completed a detailed questionnaire about diet during adolescence. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. We documented 1132 breast cancer cases during 13-year follow-up. In multivariable Cox regression models with major breast cancer risk factors adjustment, greater consumption of total red meat in adolescence was significantly associated with higher premenopausal breast cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quintiles, RR, 1.43; 95%CI, 1.05-1.94; Ptrend = 0.007), but not postmenopausal breast cancer. Adolescent intake of poultry was associated with lower risk of breast cancer overall (RR, 0.76; 95%CI, 0.60-0.97; for each serving/day). Adolescent intakes of iron, heme iron, fish, eggs, legumes and nuts were not associated with breast cancer. Replacement of one serving/day of total red meat with one serving of combination of poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts was associated with a 15% lower risk of breast cancer overall (RR, 0.85; 95%CI, 0.74-0.96) and a 23% lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer (RR, 0.77; 95%CI, 0.64-0.92). In conclusion, higher consumption of red meat during adolescence was associated with premenopausal breast cancer.

From July 2010 to April 2019, 2502 newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients and 2538 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited in this case-control study. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between the educational level and colorectal cancer risk. Path analysis was used to investigate whether behavioral risk factors potentially mediated the association between the educational level and colorectal cancer risk. Educational level was inversely associated with the colorectal cancer risk. People who graduated from the college or above had a lower risk of colorectal cancer than those from the primary school or below, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.42 [95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.34-0.52]. The total, direct and indirect effects of the educational level for the colorectal cancer risk were statistically significant in the path diagram. Path analysis showed that lower red and processed meat intake and higher tea and coffee drinking among high educational participants contributed to the inverse association between the educational level and colorectal cancer risk.

A multivariable conditional regression model was used to adjust for the association between study factors and CRC risk. In the model, compared with controls, cases from villages were significantly less likely to have CRC (Adjusted Odds Ratio, AOR = 0.194); taking aspirin lowered the likelihood of CRC by 24%; and having a multiple birth sibling by 33%. Also, the likelihood of CRC was lowered significantly by consuming five servings of fruits/vegetables per week or more (5-6 servings: AOR = 0.21, 7-8 servings per week: AOR = 0.04).

We included 29 observational prospective cohort studies with relative risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals for CRC according to various levels of processed meat consumption. Risk of bias was assessed using Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. Data sources were PubMed and Embase up to January 2017. The summary relative risks for high versus low processed meat consumption and risk of CRC, colon, and rectal cancer were 1.13 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.26), 1.19 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.31), and 1.21 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.49), respectively. Similar estimates were observed for the dose-response analyses. Heterogeneity across studies was detected in most analytical models. The overall judgment showed that two out of 29 studies had a moderate risk of bias, 25 had a serious risk of bias, and 2 had a critical risk of bias. The bias domains most often rated critical were bias due to risk of confounding, bias due to missing data, and selective outcome reporting bias. Although this meta-analysis indicates a modest association between processed meat intake and an increased risk of CRC, our assessment of internal validity warrants a cautious interpretation of these results, as most of the included studies were judged to have serious or critical risks of bias.",pubmed

A strong association between high Body Mass Index (BMI) and Colorectal Cancer (CRC) has been well established. However, the global burden of CRC attributable to high BMI remains underexplored. This study aims to examine and analyze the burden of CRC linked to high BMI at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2021. A descriptive analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021. Data on the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), as well as age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR), were extracted from the GBD 2021. Average annual percentage change (AAPC) was calculated to evaluate the temporal change in ASDR and ASMR using Joinpoint regression analysis. The Population Attributable Fractions (PAF) were used to analyze the CRC burden attributed to risk factors. In 2021, the global deaths and DALYs of CRC attributed to high BMI were 99,270 deaths and 2,364,660 years respectively, more than double the figures from 1990. High SDI regions bore the greatest burden while low-middle and middle SDI regions experienced a faster rise, with individuals over 60 and males being the most affected. East Asia, particularly China, had the heaviest burden globally. ASMR and ASDR were correlated with SDI. The top five risk factors for CRC burden were a diet low in whole grains (17.72 %), a diet low in milk (15.10 %), a diet high in red meat (14.55 %), high BMI (9.69 %) and a diet low in calcium (8.20 %) in 2021. High BMI is a significant risk factor for CRC, with aging, population growth, gender, and SDI contributing to geographic and temporal variations in the burden. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted prevention strategies, especially in high-risk populations, and emphasize the role of obesity prevention, early screening, lifestyle and dietary modifications, and interventions such as AI-driven technologies to reduce the CRC burden.",pubmed

This retrospective study included 4159 patients over the age of 55 who were diagnosed with postmenopausal breast (52.2%), prostate (38.7%), or colon cancer (9.1%). Prior to treatment, patients were screened for problem-related distress using a 33-item touch screen-based instrument. Descriptive statistics were generated for each cancer type and one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) used to determine significant differences in distress by weight (nonobese: <30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs obese: ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ). A higher prevalence of biopsychosocial problem-related distress was reported by patients with breast cancer (M = 4.3) compared with prostate (M = 2.8) and colon cancer (M = 3.8). Obese breast and prostate cancer patients reported higher levels of problem-related distress compared with nonobese patients (P < .05), whereas an opposite trend was noted for patients with colon cancer. The current study found notable obesity-related differences among patients diagnosed with postmenopausal breast cancer or prostate cancer, with excess weight consistently associated with poorer psychosocial outcomes.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant health concern, often linked to western diets, particularly red meat consumption. Several mechanisms, such as the high heme iron content, the formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs), heterocyclic amines (HCAs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), have been suggested to explain red meat's cancer-promoting effects. However, these factors are also found in fish and poultry, which are not linked to CRC risk. A new hypothesis attributes red meat's impact on CRC to its high content of a nonhuman glycan. While most mammals express N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), humans express only Neu5Ac due to the loss of the CMAH enzyme. A red meat-rich diet leads to the incorporation of Neu5Gc into human cells, triggering an antibody-mediated inflammatory process known as xenosialitis. This study shows that Neu5Gc incorporation into CRC cells activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation. In a murine model lacking CMAH, a Neu5Gc-enriched diet induced intestinal polyp growth, with more malignant characteristics. Additionally, Neu5Gc incorporation in intestinal cells increased the expression of genes downstream of Wnt signaling. These findings reveal, for the first time in an in vivo model, a mechanism independent of immune response, where red meat consumption accelerates tumor progression through Neu5Gc incorporation. This activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway provides new insight into how red meat consumption may influence CRC progression.",pubmed

Unhealthy dietary habits, sedentary routines, and obesity have been identified as one of the key contributors to the development of colorectal cancer, apart from genetic and epigenetic modifications. Recognizing the profound impact of diet and lifestyle on the intricate gut microbiota ecosystem offers a promising avenue for understanding CRC development and its treatment. Gut dysbiosis, characterized by imbalances favoring harmful microbes over beneficial ones, has emerged as a defining feature of CRC. Changes in diet and lifestyle can profoundly alter the composition of gut microbes and the metabolites they produce, potentially contributing to CRC onset.

In parallel, hypotheses on carcinogenic mechanisms underlying an association between CRC and the intake of red and processed red meat have been proposed and investigated in biological studies. The hypotheses that have received most attention until now include (1) the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic amines, two groups of compounds recognized as carcinogenic, (2) the enhancing effect of (nitrosyl)heme on the formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds and lipid peroxidation. However, none of these hypotheses completely explains the link between red and processed red meat intake and the CRC risk.

Overall 51% of survivors had undergone a screening colonoscopy. However, there was a difference in CRC screening rate between prostate (54%) and breast (44%) cancer survivors. Older age (≥65 years), being a breast cancer survivor compared to prostate cancer, and living in a large compared to small metropolitan area were associated with a lower probability of receiving CRC screening. Having hypertension was associated with higher likelihood of being current on colonoscopy screening guidelines among survivors; but diabetes and obesity were not associated with CRC screening.

Risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) is increased in adults with poor diet quality, low socioeconomic status, and increased body mass index (BMI). Cooked meats contain high contents of mutagenic compounds related to CRC risk. To explore differences in meat-based carcinogen exposure, a 99-item Qualtrics survey was issued to 1648 US adults. Average monthly serving size, degree of doneness, and cooking methods of meat products were obtained. The National Cancer Institute CHARRED database was used to quantify exposure to HCAs, PAHs, and Ames Predicted and Estimated mutagenicity. Questions from validated instruments assessed food security status (FSS) and demographic variables, while height and weight were self-reported to calculate BMI. Sex, FSS and obesity status (BMI > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were compared using two-sample t-tests and multivariate regression models to determine differences in meat intake and carcinogen exposure. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Eight hundred fifty-six valid responses (57.4% female and 81.8% white) were obtained. Non-obese males consumed more white meat and were exposed to greater amounts of 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline.

It is well known that regular moderate physical activity, in the context of a healthy lifestyle, significantly reduces the likelihood of cardiovascular events, both in primary and secondary prevention. In addition, it is scientifically proven that exercise can reduce the incidence of diabetes, osteoporosis, depression, breast cancer and colon cancer. Despite this strong evidence, sedentary lifestyle remains a widespread habit in the western world. Even in Italy the adult population has a poor attitude to regular physical activity. It is therefore necessary, as continuously recommended by the World Health Organization, to motivate people to ""move"" since the transition from inactivity to regular light to moderate physical activity has a huge impact on health, resulting in significant savings of resources. We do not need to be athletes to exercise - it should be part of all our daily routines.",pubmed

Cancer health disparities by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography are a top public health priority. Breast and colorectal cancer, in particular, have been shown to exhibit significant disparities and contribute a large proportion of morbidity and mortality from cancer. In addition, breast and colorectal cancer offer targets for prevention and control, including nutrition, physical activity, screening, and effective treatments to prolong and enhance the quality of survival. However, despite the investment of significant time and resources over many years, breast and colorectal cancer disparities persist, and in some cases, may be growing. This paper examines breast and colorectal cancer survival disparities in an 8-county region in southeastern Wisconsin, including the City of Milwaukee. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine survival trends, and a new adaptation of adaptive spatial filtering--a disease mapping method--was used to examine spatial patterns of survival. Disparities by race and ethnicity are revealed, and spatial analyses identify specific areas within the study region that have lower than expected survival rates. Cancer control efforts in southeastern Wisconsin should focus on black/African American and Hispanic/Latina women to reduce breast cancer survival disparities, and black/African American populations to reduce colorectal cancer disparities. Evidence indicates that targeted interventions may be needed to serve populations in the Milwaukee and Kenosha metropolitan areas, as well as areas of Walworth, Ozaukee, and Waukesha counties.",pubmed

Although obesity has now been widely accepted to be an important risk factor for cancer survival, the associations between BMI and cancer mortality have not been consistently linear. Although morbid obesity has clearly been associated with worse survival, some studies have suggested a U-shaped association with no adverse association with overweight or lower levels of obesity. This 'obesity paradox' may be due to the fact that BMI likely incompletely captures key measures of body composition, including distribution of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Fat and lean body mass can be measured using clinically acquired computed tomography scans. Many of the earlier studies focused on patients with metastatic cancer. However, skeletal muscle loss in the metastatic setting may reflect end-stage disease processes. Therefore, this article focuses on the clinical implication of low skeletal muscle mass in early-stage non-metastatic breast and colorectal cancer where measures of body composition have been shown to be strong predictors of disease-free survival and overall survival and also chemotherapy toxicity and operative risk.",pubmed

On October 26, 2015, IARC published a summary of their findings regarding the association of cancer with consumption of red meat or processed meat (IARC 2015; The Lancet Oncology 2015). The Working Group concluded that there is limited evidence in human beings for carcinogenicity from the consumption of red meat and inadequate evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of consumption of red meat. Nevertheless, the working group concluded that there is strong mechanistic evidence by which ingestion of red meat can be linked to human colorectal cancer and assigned red meat to Group 2A ""probably carcinogenic to humans"". The Working Group cited supporting mechanistic evidence for multiple meat components, including those formed from meat processing, such as N-nitroso compounds (NOC) and heterocyclic aromatic amines, and the endogenous compound, heme iron. The mechanism of action for each of these components is different and so it is critical to evaluate the evidence for each component separately. Consequently, this review critically examined studies that investigated mechanistic evidence associated with heme iron to assess the weight of the evidence associating exposure to red meat with colorectal cancer. The evidence from in vitro studies utilized conditions that are not necessarily relevant for a normal dietary intake and thus do not provide sufficient evidence that heme exposure from typical red meat consumption would increase the risk of colon cancer. Animal studies utilized models that tested promotion of preneoplastic conditions utilizing diets low in calcium, high in fat combined with exaggerations of heme exposure that in many instances represented intakes that were orders of magnitude above normal dietary consumption of red meat. Finally, clinical evidence suggests that the type of NOC found after ingestion of red meat in humans consists mainly of nitrosyl iron and nitrosothiols, products that have profoundly different chemistries from certain N-nitroso species which have been shown to be tumorigenic through the formation of DNA adducts. In conclusion, the methodologies employed in current studies of heme have not provided sufficient documentation that the mechanisms studied would contribute to an increased risk of promotion of preneoplasia or colon cancer at usual dietary intakes of red meat in the context of a normal diet.",pubmed

Colorectal cancer (CRC) refers to cancer that develops in the colon or rectum, parts of the large intestine. It ranks as the third most prevalent form of cancer globally. Colorectal cancer is responsible for the morbidity of millions and the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide although the incidence varies significantly depending on geographical location. In recent years, CRC has decreased in high-income countries due to technological advancements in diagnosis and treatment. However, there is an increased occurrence of CRC morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries. Colorectal cancer is becoming an emerging public health concern in Ethiopia. We noticed that the incidence rates have been lower compared to more developed countries, but recent years have seen a noticeable increase. This rise is attributed to factors such as changes in diet, lifestyle, and an aging population. Common risk factors include dietary shifts towards processed foods and red meat, physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, in Ethiopia, screening programs for CRC are not widespread, and limited access to diagnostic facilities, lack of public awareness, and insufficient healthcare infrastructure contribute to late-stage diagnoses or left without diagnosis. Treatment options, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, are available but not uniformly accessible across the country, posing challenges for timely and effective treatment. Addressing colorectal cancer in Ethiopia requires a comprehensive approach to enhance public awareness, improve screening and early detection, expand treatment facilities, and train healthcare professionals to provide effective care.",pubmed

Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between different dietary protein sources and breast cancer risk. PubMed and several databases were searched until December 2015. Relevant articles were retrieved according to specific searching criteria. Forty-six prospective studies were included. The summary relative risk (RR) for highest versus lowest intake was 1.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.14, <i>I</i>² = 34.6%) for processed meat, 0.92 (95% CI 0.84-1.00, <i>I</i>² = 0%) for soy food, 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-1.00, <i>I</i>² = 40.1%) for skim milk, and 0.90 (95% CI 0.82-1.00, <i>I</i>² = 0%) for yogurt.

cancer_35999486,35999486,cancer,2022.0,"The effect of obesity on adipose-derived stromal cells and adipose tissue and their impact on cancer.. The significant increase in the incidence of obesity represents the next global health crisis. As a result, scientific research has focused on gaining deeper insights into obesity and adipose tissue biology. As a result of the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue, obesity results from hyperplasia and hypertrophy within the adipose tissue. The functional alterations in the adipose tissue are a confounding contributing factor to many diseases, including cancer. The increased incidence and aggressiveness of several cancers, including colorectal, postmenopausal breast, endometrial, prostate, esophageal, hematological, malignant melanoma, and renal carcinomas, result from obesity as a contributing factor. The increased morbidity and mortality of obesity-associated cancers are attributable to increased hormones, adipokines, and cytokines produced by the adipose tissue. The increased adipose tissue levels observed in obese patients result in more adipose stromal/stem cells (ASCs) distributed throughout the body. ASCs have been shown to impact cancer progression in vitro and in preclinical animal models. ASCs influence tumor biology via multiple mechanisms, including the increased recruitment of ASCs to the tumor site and increased production of cytokines and growth factors by ASCs and other cells within the tumor stroma. Emerging evidence indicates that obesity induces alterations in the biological properties of ASCs, subsequently leading to enhanced tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancer cells. As the focus of this review is the interaction and impact of ASCs on cancer, the presentation is limited to preclinical data generated on cancers in which there is a demonstrated role for ASCs, such as postmenopausal breast, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, multiple myeloma, osteosarcoma, cervical, bladder, and gastrointestinal cancers. Our group has investigated the interactions between obesity and breast cancer and the mechanisms that regulate ASCs and adipocytes in these different contexts through interactions between cancer cells, immune cells, and other cell types present in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are discussed. The reciprocal and circular feedback loop between obesity and ASCs and the mechanisms by which ASCs from obese patients alter the biology of cancer cells and enhance tumorigenesis will be discussed. At present, the evidence for ASCs directly influencing human tumor growth is somewhat limited, though recent clinical studies suggest there may be some link.",pubmed

The growing incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the world seems to be related to the spread of Westernized lifestyles, particularly dietary habits. Several studies have found that high consumption of red meat-especially processed red meat, a mainstay of Western diets-is associated with an increased risk of developing CRC. One possible reason for the association are the adverse effects exerted by the heme iron contained in red meat, which has the potential to affect homeostasis and colonic epithelial cell renewal and to promote the formation of mutagenic and carcinogenic agents. A correlation has also emerged between CRC and alterations of the gut microbiota, since the micro-organisms found in the intestinal lumen seem to influence the activation of enterocyte genes involved in the initiation and progression of carcinogenesis. Dietary habits can therefore modify the gut microbiota, affecting gene activation and favoring the development of cancer cells. We review and discuss the most recent literature on the hypothesis that heme iron can exert adverse effects by altering the gut microbiota and colorectal epithelial cell homeostasis.",pubmed

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a worldwide health problem, being the third most commonly detected cancer in males and the second in females. Rising CRC incidence trends are mainly regarded as a part of the rapid 'Westernization' of life-style and are associated with calorically excessive high-fat/low-fibre diet, consumption of refined products, lack of physical activity, and obesity. Most recent epidemiological and clinical investigations have consistently evidenced a significant relationship between obesity-driven inflammation in particular steps of colorectal cancer development, including initiation, promotion, progression, and metastasis. Inflammation in obesity occurs by several mechanisms. Roles of imbalanced metabolism (MetS), distinct immune cells, cytokines, and other immune mediators have been suggested in the inflammatory processes. Critical mechanisms are accounted to proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). These molecules are secreted by macrophages and are considered as major agents in the transition between acute and chronic inflammation and inflammation-related CRC. The second factor promoting the CRC development in obese individuals is altered adipokine concentrations (leptin and adiponectin). The role of leptin and adiponectin in cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis is attributable to the activation of several signal transduction pathways (JAK/STAT, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), mTOR, and 5'AMPK signaling pathways) and multiple dysregulation (COX-2 downregulation, mRNA expression).",pubmed

Probiotics may be helpful in the prevention of cancer and may provide support during treatment. The main aim of this study is to characterize the potential mechanisms of action of probiotics, in particular the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. Probiotics' potential mechanisms of action are, for example, modification of intestinal microbiota, improvement of colonic physicochemical conditions, production of anticancerogenic and antioxidant metabolites against carcinogenesis, a decrease in intestinal inflammation, and the production of harmful enzymes. The prevention of colorectal cancer is associated with favorable quantitative and qualitative changes in the intestinal microbiota, as well as changes in metabolic activity and in the physicochemical conditions of the intestine.

First use at age 60 years or older was inversely associated with: total mortality, obesity- and smoking-associated mortality, and colorectal cancer mortality; and total incidence, obesity- and smoking-associated incidence, and breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer incidence. This study provides additional evidence for inverse associations between lipid-lowering drug use and cancer incidence and mortality but a positive association with bladder cancer incidence in men. Evaluation of the impact of chemoprevention strategies that include lipid-lowering drugs on population-level cancer burden is needed.",pubmed

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-highest cause of cancer-associated mortality among both men and women worldwide. One of the risk factors for CRC is obesity, which is correlated with a high-fat diet prevalent in Western dietary habits. The association between an obesogenic high-fat diet and CRC has been established for several decades; however, the mechanisms by which a high-fat diet increases the risk of CRC remain unclear. Recent studies indicate that gut microbiota strongly influence the pathogenesis of both high-fat diet-induced obesity and CRC. The gut microbiota is composed of hundreds of bacterial species, some of which are implicated in CRC. In particular, the expansion of facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae, which is considered a microbial signature of intestinal microbiota functional imbalance (dysbiosis), is associated with both high-fat diet-induced obesity and CRC. Here, we review the interaction between the gut microbiome and its metabolic byproducts in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC) during high-fat diet-induced obesity. In addition, we will cover how a high-fat diet can drive the expansion of genotoxin-producing Escherichia coli by altering intestinal epithelial cell metabolism during gut inflammation conditions.",pubmed

Evidence that lifestyle factors are associated with better outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors highlights the need for behaviour change interventions. This study examined feasibility and acceptability, and provided an indication of behavioural impact, of a telephone-based, multimodal health behaviour intervention for CRC survivors. Participants were recruited from five London hospitals. Patients (n = 29) who had recently completed treatment for CRC participated in a 12 week intervention. Behavioural goals were to increase physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake, and reduce consumption of red/processed meat and alcohol. Self-report measures of PA and diet were completed in all patients, supplemented by objective measures in a sub-set. Uptake of the study when patients were approached by a researcher was high (72%), compared with 27% contacted by letter. Methods for identifying eligible patients were not optimal. Study completion rate was high (79%), and completers evaluated the intervention favourably. Significant improvements were observed in objectively-measured activity (+70 min/week; p = .004). Gains were seen in diet: +3 F&V portions a day (p < .001), -147 g of red meat a week (p = .013), -0.83 portions of processed meat a week (p = .002). Changes in serum vitamin levels were not statistically significant, but the small sample size provides limited power. Clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life (p < .001) was observed.

A contemporary study based on the Health Promotion Model may systematically broaden the understanding of physical activity in colorectal cancer patients. To understand the status of physical activity in Chinese colorectal cancer patients and to explore the correlated factors. A total of 168 adults with colorectal cancer were recruited at 3 tertiary hospitals in China. Participant data were collected on demographics, physical activity, biological factors, anxiety and depression, benefits/barriers to physical activity, self-efficacy, and social support. SAS 8.2 was used for statistical analysis, including descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, single factor analysis, and multiple stepwise regression analysis. Only 25.60% of colorectal cancer survivors reached the requirements of the Colorectal Cancer Survivorship Care Guidelines. Employment states, number of complications, fatigue, body image, depression, perception of benefits/barriers, and self-efficacy were closely correlated with physical activity in Chinese colorectal cancer patients. The physical activity status of patients with colorectal cancer is not optimal. The correlated factors that nurses can take measures to improve are fatigue, body image, depression, perception of benefits/barriers, and self-efficacy, which may improve physical activity in colorectal cancer patients in China.

While direct relationships between muscle activity, adipose tissue and breast tissue have been highlighted in recent years, few studies have focused on the effects of obesity and physical activity during the development of breast cancer, particularly at the level of cell signaling. Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue modulate the cell metabolism by secreting myokines and adipokines. These secreted cytokines belong to a crosstalk network via cell signaling pathway modulation. The understanding of the tissue crosstalk is fundamental to the management of physical activity in the care of obese breast cancer patients. Therefore, this review focuses on the effects of obesity and physical activity during the development of breast cancer, particularly at the level of cell signaling.

High red meat consumption is a main modifiable risk factor for colorectal cancer mortality (CRC), but its attributable disease burden remains unclear in China. We aimed to analyze the temporal trends in CRC deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to high red meat consumption in China from 1990 to 2021 and to predict the disease burden in the next 15 years. Data was obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study. The Joinpoint regression model was used to calculate the annual percentage change (APC) and the average annual percentage change (AAPC). In addition, the age-period-cohort (APC) model was employed to explore the effects of age, period, and cohort on CRC mortality. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was utilized to predict the disease burden in 2022-2036. We also compared the CRC burden attributed to high red meat in China with 204 countries worldwide. The results showed that the number of CRC deaths in China due to high red meat consumption increased nearly 2.5 times, from 17,608 (95% UI: -3 to 36,613) in 1990 to 43,580 (95% UI: -16 to 92,083) in 2021. Male CRC deaths exhibited a more pronounced increase, rising from 9,800 in 1990 to 27,600 in 2021. Additionally, the number of DALYs increased from 518,213 (95% UI: -105,107 to 1,074,174) in 1990 to 1,091,788 (95% UI: -509 to 2,295,779) in 2021.

When age, period, and cohort effects were examined as the reference group, the risk of CRC was found to increase with age. However, women experienced a marked decline in both period and cohort effects compared to men. Compared to global levels, the burden in China is heavier. In terms of mortality or DALY standardized rates, Chinese women show a similar downward trend to the overall trend, while Chinese men show a striking upward trend.

In order to explore the association between meat consumption and gastrointestinal/colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and to estimate the Israeli population attributable fraction (PAF), we conducted a collaborative historical cohort study using the individual participant data of seven nutritional studies from the past 6 decades. We included healthy adult men and women who underwent a nutritional interview. Dietary assessment data, using food-frequency or 24-h recall questionnaires, were harmonized. The study file was linked to the National Cancer and death registries. Among 27,754 participants, 1216 (4.4%) were diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancers and 839 (3.0%) with CRC by the end of 2016. Using meta-analysis methods applied to Cox proportional hazard models (adjusted for daily energy intake, sex, age, ethnic origin, education and smoking),100 g/day increments in beef, red meat and poultry consumption, and 50 g/day increment in processed meat consumption were associated with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals of 1.46 (1.06-2.02), 1.15 (0.87-1.52), 1.06 (0.89-1.26), and 0.93 (0.76-1.12), respectively, for CRC.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, with rising incidence in younger populations. Red meat consumption has been proposed as a risk factor for CRC, though the evidence remains inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the associations between the consumption of beef, pork, and lamb with CRC, colon cancer (CC), and rectal cancer (RC) risk. The findings from 27 studies published between 1993 and 2024 were included, involving over 1 million participants from diverse geographical regions. Relative risks were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis, with subgroup and meta-regression analyses performed to assess potential sources of heterogeneity. Beef consumption was significantly associated with increased CRC risk, with a 30% overall risk increase (95% CI: 1.10-1.54). The association with colon cancer (CC) was marginally significant (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.99-1.43, p = 0.0585), while the link to rectal cancer (RC) was not statistically significant. Pork consumption was associated with a 17% increased CRC risk (95% CI: 1.09-1.25), with similar, nonsignificant trends for CC and RC. Lamb consumption was weakly associated with an 11% increase in CRC risk (95% CI: 1.02-1.21), though this was based on limited studies (n = 6), and no significant associations emerged for cancer subtypes. Study design and confounding factors influenced these associations, with case-control studies reporting stronger associations than cohort studies. Physical activity adjustments were pivotal, as studies without this adjustment consistently reported higher-risk estimates. These findings emphasise the importance of accounting several lifestyle factors in future research and public health guidance. While these results support current dietary guidelines recommending limited red meat consumption, they also underscore the complexity of diet-cancer relationships and the need for comprehensive, lifestyle-inclusive cancer prevention strategies.",pubmed

Prospective cohort studies on diet and cancer report risk associations as hazard ratios. But hazard ratios do not inform on the number of people who need to alter their dietary behaviours for preventing cancer. The objective of this study is to estimate the number of people that need to alter their diet for preventing one additional case of female breast or colorectal cancer. Based on the largest prospective studies done in the USA and in Europe, we computed the number of subjects who need to alter their diet. For preventing one case of breast cancer, European women should increase their fruit consumption by 100 g/day during 33 000 person-years, and US women by 60 g/day during 10 600 person-years. For vegetables, European women should increase their consumption by 160 g/day during 26 900 person-years and US women by 100 g/day during 19 000 person-years. For preventing one case of colorectal cancer, European subjects should decrease their red meat consumption by 20 g/day during 26 100 person-years, and US subjects by 30 g/day during 8170 person-years. For processed meat, European subjects should decrease their consumption by 20 g/day during 17 400 person-years, and US subjects by 10 g/day during 7940 person-years.

Although the protective effects of physical activity against several cancers are well established, evidence is inconsistent concerning Asian populations. Therefore, we assessed the association between the characteristics of physical activity and overall and type-specific cancer incidence in Koreans and examined the differences in association according to obesity status. Using prospective data from 112,108 participants in the Health Examinees study-G from 2004 to 2013, we evaluated the association between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and the incidence of overall and type-specific cancers using the Cox proportional hazards model. Self-reported LTPA participation, duration per week, intensity, type, and diversity were assessed. The incidence of overall and type-specific cancers, including colorectal, gastric, lung, breast, and prostate cancer and 13 obesity-related cancers, was identified using the Korea Central Cancer Registry from 1999 to 2018. Analyses were also stratified according to obesity status. In overweight males, participation in vigorous LTPA [HR, 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72-0.97] and walking (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98) were associated with a lower risk of cancer overall. Regarding cancer types, climbing was marginally associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in overweight males (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37-1.00). In normal-weight females, although there was an increased risk in those performing recreational activities, this risk was attenuated when those diagnosed with thyroid cancer were excluded. In the analysis for 13 obesity-related cancers, consistent associations were found. These findings suggest the need for greater public awareness regarding physical activity among overweight individuals within the Asian population. Overall cancer risk is associated with leisure-time physical activity such as duration, intensity, type, and diversity in overweight males, but not in the general population. The decreased risk was most noticeable for colorectal cancer. Our results suggest that physical activity may reduce the risk of cancer among overweight Asian males.",pubmed

Cancer of colon and rectum (colorectal) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. There is a scarcity of published data on the risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC) from the Middle-Eastern countries specifically in Kuwait. Therefore, this matched case-control study sought to examine the risk factors associated with CRC in Kuwait. One hundred and three histopathologically confirmed colorectal cancer cases were recruited from Kuwait Cancer Control Centre Registry. Two hundred and six controls matched with cases (2:1 ratio) on age, gender and nationality were selected from medical, ophthalmology, orthopedic and/ or surgical out-patient clinics at three main general hospitals in Kuwait. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data from cases and controls through face-to-face interview. Adjusted matched odds ratios (mOR<sub>adj</sub>) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using a multivariable conditional logistic regression model. Multivariable conditional logistic regression model showed that cases were 4.3 times more likely to have had attainted obesity (BMI ≥ 30) in their lifetime compared to controls (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 4.3; 95% CI: 1.6-11.4). Compared to controls, cases rarely consumed fruits and vegetable (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 20.8; 95% CI: 4.4-99.5), tended to consume red meat 2-3 times a week (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 3.8; 95% CI: 1.6-8.7) or more than 4 times a week (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 9.4; 95% CI: 2.5-35.4). Reportedly cases compared to controls frequently (nearly every week) suffered from constipation (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 5.6; 95% CI: 1.9-16.5). However, CRC cases were less likely than controls to have been diagnosed in the past with hypercholesterolemia (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2-0.7) or diabetes mellitus type II (mOR<sub>adj</sub> = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-0.8). Obesity, excessive red meat consumption and infrequent fruits/vegetables intake were associated with an increased CRC risk. Overcoming identified pitfalls in dietary pattern and maintenance of healthy weight may help minimize CRC risk in Kuwait and perhaps other countries in the region. Further studies on genetic basis in conjunction with life styles and dietary factors may unravel their joint contributions to CRC risk and furnish tools for curtailing CRC risk in this and other similar populations.",pubmed

RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR COLORECTAL CANCER Behaviour and environment play a more important role than heredity in colorectal carcinogenesis. The proportion of colorectal cancers (CRCs) attributable to occupational exposure, pollution or poor socio- economic status is low. The risk levels on which the French CRC screening recommendations are based are obsolete and need to be updated. An individual with one or two non-advanced adenomas resected at colonoscopy is at low risk of CRC. Only a first-degree family history of CRC in one parent before age 50 or in two parents at any age confers a significant increased risk. Certain diseases or situations that are sources of an increased risk of CRC were not previously considered: cystic fibrosis, radiotherapy and paediatric cancer survivors. New inherited predisposition syndromes associated with a very high risk of CRC have been described in addition to Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis: MUTYH-associated polyposis, constitutional MMR deficiency, Lynch-like, PPAP and X syndromes. Half of all CRCs are related to modifiable risk factors associated with westernized lifestyle such as physical inactivity, junk food and obesity. There is nothing specific about dietary recommendations for the primary prevention of CRC: physical activity, limitation of red and processed meat, increase in dietary fibre and dairy products, limitation of alcohol and avoidance of tobacco. Finally, it is premature to use aspirin in primary prevention of CRC outside of Lynch syndrome and associated significant cardiovascular risk.",pubmed

Our purposes were to estimate the rate and modifiers of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening adherence among underweight women and compare it to other body mass index (BMI) categories. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We used sampling weighted data from 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of age-eligible women (breast cancer screening, <i>n</i> = 163,164; cervical, <i>n</i> = 113,883 and colorectal, <i>n</i> = 128,287). We defined breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening using the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines. We calculated the prevalence of screening among four BMI categories (underweight <18.5, normal weight ≥18.5 to <25, overweight ≥25 to <30, and obese ≥30). Logistic regression models assessed the independent effect of BMI on screening adherence. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Underweight women had significantly lower breast (62.9%), cervical (67.5%), and colorectal (62.6%) cancer screening rates compared to other BMI categories. In logistic regression models, being underweight was associated with decreased odds of breast (odds ratio [OR] = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49-0.88) and cervical (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.34-0.84), but not colorectal (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.66-1.18) cancer screening adherence. We did not demonstrate a significant association between obesity and screening rates for any of the three cancers. Underweight women reported higher rates of smoking and lower levels of educational attainment, income, and insurance coverage compared to all other groups. Higher rates of chronic illness and health access hardship were observed among underweight women. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> BMI variably affects cancer screening. Compared to normal-weight women, being underweight is associated with breast and cervical cancer screening nonadherence.

A recent investigation by the World Health Organisation (WHO) has found that the consumption of processed meat and potentially red meat promotes carcinogenesis and can increase the risk of colorectal cancer. This literature review aims to summarise both the red and processed meat molecules associated with colorectal carcinogenesis and investigate their relationship with the pathogenic process of colorectal cancer. Literature relating to the carcinogenic effect of red and processed meat molecules was critically reviewed. There are multiple molecules present in red and processed meat with a potential carcinogenic effect on colorectal tissues. Processed meat is more carcinogenic compared to red meat because of the abundance of potent nitrosyl-heme molecules that form N-nitroso compounds. Studies have also noted that other molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines have potential mechanisms for the initiation of colorectal cancer pathogenesis. The non-human sugar molecule N-glycolylneuraminic acid may account for the carcinogenic effects of pork despite its heme content being comparable to that of chicken. Red meat products, especially those that have been processed, have a wide variety of carcinogenic molecules known to increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Thus, the outcome of this review is consistent with the recent findings of WHO.",pubmed

One possible explanation is the mutagenic activity of these foods, perhaps due to generation during cooking [e.g., heterocyclic amine (HCA) intake]. Few studies have evaluated meat intake and sessile serrated lesion (SSL) risk, a recently recognized precursor, and no study has evaluated meat cooking methods and meat-derived mutagens with SSL risk.

A balanced diet with an emphasis on plant-based foods and limited consumption of red meat, processed meats, alcohol, and refined sugar is recommended for cancer patients and survivors. Physical activity is also important, with recommendations of 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily, aiming for 150 minutes per week. Mind-body approaches such as meditation, yoga have been shown to improve emotional self-regulation, anxiety, depression, and other symptoms. Acupuncture has demonstrated potential benefits for aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal symptoms, hot flashes, peripheral neuropathy, and fatigue. Massage may help address pain, anxiety, stress, and improve quality of life (QoL). Supplement use should be approached with caution, especially during active treatment, due to potential interactions with cancer therapies. The review highlights the role of specialized integrative medicine practitioners, such as naturopathic doctors and acupuncturists, in safely incorporating these therapies into standard cancer care. This collaborative approach supports survivors' diverse needs and empowers them to actively participate in their recovery, ultimately improving health outcomes and QoL.

A total of 1973 pathways using ADABF, and 840 pathways using ORA, out of the 2950 analysed, were enriched (P < 0.05) for at least one exposure, as well as 1227 genes within the enriched pathways. Data were available for 811/1227 coding genes in the OTP, 241 of which were supported by strong relative abundance of prior evidence (overall OTP score > 0.05). Fifty percent of the genes (617/1227) mapped to at least one hallmark of cancer, most of which (388/617) pertained to the Sustaining Proliferative Signalling hallmark.

This MR analysis analyzed data of 3022 colorectal cancer cases and 174,006 controls from the FinnGen database. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with unhealthy lifestyle factors were selected as instrumental variables (IVs), including two obesity-related indicators, BMI (body mass index) and WHR (waist-to-hip ratio). Four phenotypes of smoking (smoking initiation, ever smoked, smoking per day, smoking cessation) and one phenotype of alcohol consumption (drinks per week). Four phenotypes of physical activity (accelerometer-based physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, vigorous physical activity, strenuous sports or other exercises). All SNPs were obtained from published genome-wide association studies. The study found that the obesity-related indicator, higher WHR (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.12-1.70; P = 0.002) were associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and two smoking phenotypes, cigarettes per day(OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.01-1.68; P = 0.042)and smoking initiation (OR = 3.48, 95% CI 1.15-10.55; P = 0.028), were potentially associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

Compared with the abundant data from Western countries, evidence regarding meat consumption and colorectal cancer is limited in the Japanese population. We evaluated colorectal cancer risk in relation to meat consumption in a population-based prospective cohort study in Japan. Participants were 13 957 men and 16 374 women aged ≥35 years in September 1992. Meat intake, assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire, was controlled for the total energy intake. The incidence of colorectal cancer was confirmed through regional population-based cancer registries and histological identification from colonoscopy in two main hospitals in the study area. From September 1992 to March 2008, 429 men and 343 women developed colorectal cancer. After adjustments for multiple confounders, a significantly increased relative risk of colorectal cancer was observed in the highest versus lowest quartile of the intake of total and red meat among men; the estimated hazard ratios were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.79) for total meat (P for trend = 0.022), and 1.44 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.89) for red meat (P for trend = 0.009). A positive association between processed meat intake and colon cancer risk was also observed in men. There was no significant association between colorectal cancer and meat consumption in women. These results suggest that the intake of red and processed meat increases the risk of colorectal or colon cancer among Japanese men. Abstaining from excessive consumption of meat might be protective against developing colorectal cancer.",pubmed

Colorectal cancer is the third most prevalent cancer globally and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. It typically develops over years through the progression of benign polyps to malignancy, driven by genetic alterations-either spontaneous or inherited. This review summarizes current knowledge on colorectal cancer, including its epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic methods, treatment strategies, preventative measures, and research developments, while identifying knowledge gaps to guide future studies. Colorectal cancer is influenced by numerous lifestyle-related risk factors, such as high-calorie diets, processed foods, red meat, smoking, obesity, and alcohol use. Colonoscopy, imaging tests, and biopsies remain essential for diagnosis, while the TNM staging system continues to guide therapeutic decisions. Treatment options range from early-stage surgical interventions to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies in advanced stages, with neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments offering improved outcomes. Experimental therapies, including regorafenib and cancer vaccines, are under investigation. Prevention strategies focus on healthy lifestyles and risk avoidance, alongside screening techniques including fecal occult blood tests, colonoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy. Screening programs emphasize individuals with genetic susceptibility, and clinical trials aim to enhance both screening and therapeutic approaches. Colorectal cancer poses a substantial global health challenge. Advances in diagnostics, treatment, and prevention are promising, but further research is needed to improve management strategies and address gaps in screening. Lifestyle changes and early detection through targeted screening remain critical for reducing the disease burden worldwide.",pubmed

To examine the association between red meat subtypes intake and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) among Jewish and Arabs populations in a unique Mediterranean environment. The Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study (n=10 026) is a prospective population-based case-control study in northern Israel. Participants were interviewed in-person about their dietary intake and lifestyle using a questionnaire that included a food-frequency questionnaire. Red meat consumption in Israel was found to be especially low in the Jewish population (1.29±1.45 servings/week), but higher in Arabs (3.0±1.98 servings/week) (P<0.001). Beef was the most commonly consumed red meat by Jews (1.15/1.29 servings/week, 89%) and proportionally less so by Arabs (2.00/3.00, 67%). Processed meat consumption (mostly pork free) was lower among Arabs (0.9±1.56 servings/week) compared with Jews (1.97±2.97 servings/week) (P<0.001). The adjusted odds of CRC per one serving/week of red meat were 1.05 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.08) in Jews and 0.94 (0.88-1.01) in Arabs. Compared with no consumption, beef consumption was associated with odds ratio (OR)=0.96 (0.86-1.07) in Jews and 0.94 (0.61-1.45) in Arabs, lamb consumption with OR=1.28 (1.10-1.5) and 1.01 (0.75-1.37), pork consumption with OR=1.44 (1.24-1.67) and 1.07 (0.73-1.56), and processed meat consumption with OR=1.22 (1.10-1.35) and 1.04 (0.82-1.33) in Jews and Arabs, respectively.

Red meat and processed meat have been suggested to increase risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), especially colon cancer. However, it remains unclear whether these associations differ according to meat subtypes or colon subsites. The present study addressed this issue by undertaking a pooled analysis of large population-based cohort studies in Japan: 5 studies comprising 232 403 participants (5694 CRC cases) for analysis based on frequency of meat intake, and 2 studies comprising 123 635 participants (3550 CRC cases) for analysis based on intake quantity. Study-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model and then pooled using the random effect model. Comparing the highest vs lowest quartile, beef intake was associated with an increased risk of colon cancer in women (pooled HR 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.44) and distal colon cancer (DCC) risk in men (pooled HR 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61).

Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. CRC vary on the basis of both the biologic features of the disease and its associated lifestyle characteristics. The risk of CRC increases with several modifiable factors including obesity, physical inactivity, a diet high in red or processed meat, heavy alcohol consumption, and possibly inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables. We aimed to establish a baseline data for dietary and lifestyle characteristics of Omani adults diagnosed with CRC. Methods: A Case control study conducted at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, a referral hospital for CRC patients in Oman, and included 279 subjects (109 diagnosed CRC cases and 170 matched controls). All study subjects were recruited on volunteer basis and personally interviewed for preset questions related to sociodemographic data, anthropometric assessment, dietary intake and physical activity. Results: There was no significant difference between cases and controls regarding smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity and dietary fiber intake. However the enrolled cases were more overweight (OR =3.27. 95% CI: 1.91, 7.27), and, had a higher caloric (p =0.001) and macronutrient intake (carbohydrate: p = 0.001; protein: p = 0.017; saturated fat: P = 0.034) than the controls.

Each database follows the principle of PICOS and adopts the method of subject words combined with free words to conduct literature retrieval, such as ""colorectal cancer"" and ""behavior change intervention."" Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Continuous data using the same measurement tools were analyzed using weighted mean difference (MD). Otherwise, standard mean difference (SMD) was used for analysis. The confidence interval is 95%. There was no significant statistical heterogeneity between the studies (P > 0.1, I<sup>2</sup> < 50%), and fixed-effects model was used. There was statistical heterogeneity (P ≤ 0.1), I<sup>2</sup> ≥ 50%), and the random effects model was used for analysis. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. In total, 15 good-quality randomized controlled trials were identified. Six studies focused on eating habits. Twelve studies focused on physical activity. We found that behavior change techniques had significant effects on colorectal cancer survivors' eating behaviors such as frequency of fruit and vegetable intake and mastery of dietary knowledge (P < 0.05). The meta-analysis showed that the amount of physical activity in the intervention group increased by 71.76 min/w (16.27 to 127.24, P = 0.01) at 3 months after treatment compared with the control group.

We conducted a systematic review of epidemiological studies investigating the associations between nutritional factors, family history of colorectal cancer, and colorectal cancer risk. From the 5312 abstracts identified until December 2016, 184 full text articles were examined for eligibility. Finally, 31 articles (21 from case-control studies, 9 from cohort studies and 1 from an intervention study) met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Mainly, the combinations of family history of colorectal cancer and higher consumptions of alcoholic beverages, red or processed meat, or overweight/obesity increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Consistently, a strong increase is observed with the combinations of family history of colorectal cancer and unhealthy dietary patterns/lifestyles. Statistically significant interactions between these nutritional factors, family history of colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer risk are reported. Other data are inconclusive and additional prospective studies are needed.

The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) 2007 stated that the consumption of processed meat is a convincing cause of colorectal cancer (CRC), and therefore, the public should avoid it entirely. Sodium nitrite has emerged as a putative candidate responsible for the CRC-inducing effects of processed meats. Sodium nitrite is purported to prevent the growth of <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> and other food-spoiling bacteria, but recent, contradictory peer-reviewed evidence has emerged, leading to media reports questioning the necessity of nitrite addition. To date, eleven preclinical studies have investigated the effect of consuming nitrite/nitrite-containing meat on the development of CRC, but the results do not provide an overall consensus. A sizable number of human clinical studies have investigated the relationship between processed meat consumption and CRC risk with widely varying results. The unique approach of the present literature review was to include analysis that limited the human studies to those involving only nitrite-containing meat. The majority of these studies reported that nitrite-containing processed meat was associated with increased CRC risk. Nitrite consumption can lead to the formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOC), some of which are carcinogenic.

Emerging evidence that heme iron in red meat is a risk factor for colorectal carcinogenesis is a topic that has received recent scrutiny. This review aims to summarise the mechanism of colorectal carcinogenesis by heme contained in red and processed meat. Heme iron can induce cytotoxicity by 'cytotoxic heme factor' and promote surface epithelial cell apoptosis and compensatory epithelial hyperplasia. Heme, induces peroxidation of lipids, leading to free radical formation and generation of DNA adducts in colorectal epithelial cells. In addition, heme catalyses the formation of N-nitroso-compounds, which in turn results in the initiation of colorectal carcinogenesis. Emerging data suggest that intestinal dysbiosis can promote carcinogenic properties of heme. Heme induces multiple genetic alterations by regulating WNT signalling pathway and causing mutations in major colon cancer genes such as APC, TP53 and KRAS.

Physical activity can improve health of cancer survivors. To increase physical activity levels among colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors, we need to understand which factors affect physical activity. Therefore, this study examined the longitudinal relationship between symptom-related, functioning-related, and psychological barriers and socio-demographic and clinical factors with physical activity among CRC survivors. CRC survivors identified from the population-based Eindhoven Cancer Registry (ECR) diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 were included. Survivors completed validated questionnaires measuring moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and barriers in 2010(T1), 2011(T2), and 2012(T3). Linear-mixed models and linear regression techniques were used. Response rates were 74 % (N = 2451, T1); 47 % (N = 1547, T2); and 41 % (N = 1375, T3). Several factors were negatively associated with MVPA: symptom-related barriers (e.g., fatigue, dyspnea, chemotherapy side effects, pain, appetite loss, and weight loss); psychological barriers (i.e., depressive symptoms and anxiety); functioning-related barriers (e.g., low physical or role functioning, unfavorable future perspective); socio-demographic (i.e., older age, female, no partner); and clinical factors (i.e., obesity). However, no within-subject effects were significantly associated with MVPA. Groups of functioning-related barriers, socio-demographic factors, symptom-related barriers, psychological barriers, and clinical factors explained 11, 3.9, 3.8, 2.4, and 2.2 % of the variance in MVPA at T1, respectively. Several functioning-related and symptom-related barriers and few socio-demographic factors were associated with physical activity among CRC survivors.

We performed a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of related cohort studies published up to October 2022 investigating post-diagnosis a priori (diet quality indices) and a posteriori (data-driven) dietary patterns (DPs) in relation to all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using random-effects meta-analyses comparing highest versus lowest categories of adherence to DPs. We assessed heterogeneity and risk of bias in the selected studies. A total of 19 cohort studies with 38,846 adult CS, some assessing various DPs, were included in the meta-analyses. Higher adherence to a priori DPs was associated with lower all-cause mortality by 22% (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.73-0.83, I<sup>2</sup> = 22.6%) among all CS, by 22% (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.73-0.84, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) among breast CS and by 27% (HR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.62-0.86, I<sup>2</sup> = 41.4%) among colorectal CS. Higher adherence to a ""prudent/healthy"" DP was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64-0.97 I<sup>2</sup> = 49.3%), whereas higher adherence to a ""western/unhealthy"" DP was associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.26-1.74, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) among all CS. Results for cancer-specific mortality were less clear. In conclusion, higher adherence to a ""healthy"" DP, either a priori or a posteriori, was inversely associated with all-cause mortality among CS. A ""healthy"" overall diet after cancer diagnosis could protect and promote longevity and well-being.",pubmed

We aimed to examine the recent available evidence from observational studies about the association between these food groups’ intake and CRC risk. For this systematic review, we searched the PubMed database for the last five years. A total of fourteen cohort studies and seven case−control studies comprising a total of >60,000 cases were included. The studies showed a consistent significant decrease in CRC risk, overall and by subsites, associated with a high consumption of total dairy products. Less strong effects associated with the consumption of any subtype of dairy product were observed. Fish consumption, overall and by subtypes (oily or non-oily and fresh or canned), showed a mild inverse association with CRC risk. The association between white meat and egg intake and CRC risk was low and based on a small number of studies; thus, these findings should be interpreted with caution.

Acid-base disequilibrium is a contributor to cancer development because it affects molecular activities such as insulin-like growth factor 1 levels and adiponectin production. However, evidence of an association of diet-induced acid-base imbalance with colorectal cancer (CRC) is limited. We examined whether colorectal carcinogenesis is attributable to a diet with a high acid load. We recruited a total of 923 CRC cases and 1846 controls at the National Cancer Center in Korea for inclusion in a case-control study. We collected information on nutrient intake and specific clinical parameters of CRC by using a semiquantitative FFQ and medical records, respectively. Potential renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) were used to estimate diet-dependent acid load. We used an unconditional logistic regression model to analyse the association. Dietary acid load scores had a positive association with the odds of CRC (OR = 2·31 (95 % CI 1·79, 2·99) and OR = 2·14 (95 % CI 1·66, 2·76) for PRAL and NEAP, respectively, <i>P</i><sub>for trend</sub> < 0·001).

Furthermore, acidogenic diets appeared to affect rectal cancer more strongly than colon cancer in females. Our study contributes to reinforcing epidemiological evidence regarding a detrimental effect of acidogenic diets on colorectal carcinogenesis.

Obesity is a well-known risk factor for colorectal cancer but precisely how it influences risks of malignancy remains unclear. During colon cancer development in humans or animals, attenuation of the colonic cell surface receptor guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY2C) that occurs due to loss of its paracrine hormone ligand guanylin contributes universally to malignant progression. In this study, we explored a link between obesity and GUCY2C silencing in colorectal cancer. Using genetically engineered mice on different diets, we found that diet-induced obesity caused a loss of guanylin expression in the colon with subsequent GUCY2C silencing, epithelial dysfunction, and tumorigenesis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that obesity reversibly silenced guanylin expression through calorie-dependent induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response in intestinal epithelial cells. In transgenic mice, enforcing specific expression of guanylin in intestinal epithelial cells restored GUCY2C signaling, eliminating intestinal tumors associated with a high calorie diet. Our findings show how caloric suppression of the guanylin-GUCY2C signaling axis links obesity to negation of a universal tumor suppressor pathway in colorectal cancer, suggesting an opportunity to prevent colorectal cancer in obese patients through hormone replacement with the FDA-approved oral GUCY2C ligand linaclotide.",pubmed

To estimate the effectiveness of tailored physical activity and dietary interventions amongst adults attending colorectal and breast cancer screening. Five literature databases were systematically searched to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of tailored physical activity and/or dietary interventions with follow-up support initiated through colorectal and breast cancer screening programmes. Outcomes included markers of body fatness, physical activity, and dietary intake. Mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random effects models. Five RCTs met the inclusion criteria encompassing a total of 722 participants.

Western and prudent dietary patterns have been associated with higher and lower risks of colorectal cancer (CRC), respectively. However, little is known about the associations between dietary patterns and specific anatomic subsites or molecular subtypes of CRC. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to examine the associations between Western and prudent dietary patterns and CRC risk in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Nurses' Health Study. After up to 32 years of follow-up of 137,217 men and women, we documented 3260 cases of CRC. Among individuals from whom subsite data were available, we observed 1264 proximal colon, 866 distal colon, and 670 rectal tumors. Western diet was associated with an increased incidence of CRC (P<sub>trend</sub> < .0001), with a relative risk (RR) of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.15-1.48, comparing the highest to lowest quartile). The association of Western diet with CRC was evident for tumors of the distal colon (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.22-1.96; P<sub>trend</sub> = .0004) and rectum (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.03-1.77; P<sub>trend</sub> = .01) but not proximal colon (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.91-1.35; P<sub>trend</sub> = .51) when we comparing extreme quartiles.

However, the trend appeared stronger among men than women. Among 1285 cases (39%) with tissue available for molecular profiling, Western diet appeared to be more strongly associated with some CRC molecular subtypes (no mutations in KRAS [KRAS wildtype] or BRAF [BRAF wildtype], no or a low CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite stability), although formal tests for heterogeneity did not produce statistically significant results. Western dietary patterns are associated with an increased risk of CRC, particularly distal colon and rectal tumors. Western dietary patterns also appear more strongly associated with tumors that are KRAS wildtype, BRAF wildtype, have no or a low CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite stability. In contrast, prudent dietary patterns are associated with a lower risk of CRC that does not vary according to anatomic subsite or molecular subtype.",pubmed

Database and trial registry searches were conducted to September 2020, seeking RCTs of exercise-based interventions with ≥6-month follow-up, compared with no-exercise control for adults with myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or following coronary artery bypass graft, or percutaneous coronary intervention. The outcomes of mortality, recurrent clinical events, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis, and cost-effectiveness data were narratively synthesized. Meta-regression was used to examine effect modification. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A total of 85 RCTs involving 23 430 participants with a median 12-month follow-up were included.

Obesity has risen to epidemic levels worldwide over the past few decades and has become a huge global health burden owing to its direct contribution to the development of some of the most prevalent chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and other cardiovascular diseases. Obesity is a disease of positive energy balance resulting from complex interactions between abnormal neurohumoral responses and an individual's socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, and genetic factors leading to a state of chronic inflammation. Understanding the complex nature of the disease is crucial in determining the best approach to combat its rising numbers. Despite recent advancements in pharmacological therapy for the treatment of obesity, reversing weight gain and maintaining weight loss is challenging due to the relapsing nature of the disease. Prevention, therefore, remains the key which needs to start in utero and continued throughout life. This review summarizes the role obesity plays in the pathophysiology of various cardiovascular diseases both by directly affecting endothelial and myocyte function and indirectly by enhancing major cardiovascular risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. We highlight the importance of a holistic approach needed to prevent and treat this debilitating disease. Particularly, we analyse the effects of plant-based diet, regular exercise, and non-exercise activity thermogenesis on obesity and overall cardiorespiratory fitness.

Hypertension is a fatal yet preventable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is responsible for majority of cardiovascular mortality. Hypertension is closely associated with inactive lifestyle. Physical activity and/or exercise are shown to delay development of hypertension. Both aerobic and resistance exercise have been proven to reduce blood pressure (BP) effectively. Since brisk walking is an easy, inexpensive, simple, and effective way of exercise, this type of an aerobic workout can be recommended to society. All professional organizations and government bodies recommend moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for at least 30 min on at least 3 days of the week or resistance exercise on 2-3 days of the week. Exercise sessions can either be continuous for 30 min or be composed of at least 10 min of short exercise duration to a daily total of 30 min. After an exercise session, BP decreases, and this decline continues for up to 24 h; which is called post-exercise hypotension. Overall 5 mmHg decrease in BP with regular exercise may be ensured. With a decrease of 5 mmHg in systolic BP, mortality due to coronary heart disease decreases by 9%, mortality due to stroke decreases by 14% and all-cause mortality decreases by 7%.

Global estimates of the effect of common modifiable risk factors on cardiovascular disease and mortality are largely based on data from separate studies, using different methodologies. The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study overcomes these limitations by using similar methods to prospectively measure the effect of modifiable risk factors on cardiovascular disease and mortality across 21 countries (spanning five continents) grouped by different economic levels. In this multinational, prospective cohort study, we examined associations for 14 potentially modifiable risk factors with mortality and cardiovascular disease in 155 722 participants without a prior history of cardiovascular disease from 21 high-income, middle-income, or low-income countries (HICs, MICs, or LICs). The primary outcomes for this paper were composites of cardiovascular disease events (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure) and mortality. We describe the prevalence, hazard ratios (HRs), and population-attributable fractions (PAFs) for cardiovascular disease and mortality associated with a cluster of behavioural factors (ie, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, physical activity, and sodium intake), metabolic factors (ie, lipids, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity), socioeconomic and psychosocial factors (ie, education, symptoms of depression), grip strength, and household and ambient pollution. Associations between risk factors and the outcomes were established using multivariable Cox frailty models and using PAFs for the entire cohort, and also by countries grouped by income level. Associations are presented as HRs and PAFs with 95% CIs. Between Jan 6, 2005, and Dec 4, 2016, 155 722 participants were enrolled and followed up for measurement of risk factors. 17 249 (11·1%) participants were from HICs, 102 680 (65·9%) were from MICs, and 35 793 (23·0%) from LICs. Approximately 70% of cardiovascular disease cases and deaths in the overall study population were attributed to modifiable risk factors. Metabolic factors were the predominant risk factors for cardiovascular disease (41·2% of the PAF), with hypertension being the largest (22·3% of the PAF). As a cluster, behavioural risk factors contributed most to deaths (26·3% of the PAF), although the single largest risk factor was a low education level (12·5% of the PAF). Ambient air pollution was associated with 13·9% of the PAF for cardiovascular disease, although different statistical methods were used for this analysis. In MICs and LICs, household air pollution, poor diet, low education, and low grip strength had stronger effects on cardiovascular disease or mortality than in HICs. Most cardiovascular disease cases and deaths can be attributed to a small number of common, modifiable risk factors. While some factors have extensive global effects (eg, hypertension and education), others (eg, household air pollution and poor diet) vary by a country's economic level. Health policies should focus on risk factors that have the greatest effects on averting cardiovascular disease and death globally, with additional emphasis on risk factors of greatest importance in specific groups of countries.

This review considers the history, new evidence, controversies, and corresponding lessons for modern dietary and policy priorities for cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Major identified themes include the importance of evaluating the full diversity of diet-related risk pathways, not only blood lipids or obesity; focusing on foods and overall diet patterns, rather than single isolated nutrients; recognizing the complex influences of different foods on long-term weight regulation, rather than simply counting calories; and characterizing and implementing evidence-based strategies, including policy approaches, for lifestyle change. Evidence-informed dietary priorities include increased fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, legumes, fish, vegetable oils, yogurt, and minimally processed whole grains; and fewer red meats, processed (eg, sodium-preserved) meats, and foods rich in refined grains, starch, added sugars, salt, and trans fat. More investigation is needed on the cardiometabolic effects of phenolics, dairy fat, probiotics, fermentation, coffee, tea, cocoa, eggs, specific vegetable and tropical oils, vitamin D, individual fatty acids, and diet-microbiome interactions. Little evidence to date supports the cardiometabolic relevance of other popular priorities: eg, local, organic, grass-fed, farmed/wild, or non-genetically modified. Evidence-based personalized nutrition appears to depend more on nongenetic characteristics (eg, physical activity, abdominal adiposity, gender, socioeconomic status, culture) than genetic factors. Food choices must be strongly supported by clinical behavior change efforts, health systems reforms, novel technologies, and robust policy strategies targeting economic incentives, schools and workplaces, neighborhood environments, and the food system. Scientific advances provide crucial new insights on optimal targets and best practices to reduce the burdens of diet-related cardiometabolic diseases.",pubmed

Hypertension in older adults is related to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death. The global burden of hypertension is increasing due to an aging population and increasing prevalence of obesity, and is estimated to affect one third of the world's population by 2025. Adverse outcomes in older adults are compounded by mechanical hemodynamic changes, arterial stiffness, neurohormonal and autonomic dysregulation, and declining renal function. This review highlights the current evidence and summarizes recent guidelines on hypertension, pertaining to older adults. Management strategies for hypertension in older adults must consider the degree of frailty, increasingly complex medical comorbidities, and psycho-social factors, and must therefore be individualized. Non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions should be encouraged to mitigate the risk of developing hypertension, and as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the need for medications. Pharmacological therapy with diuretics, renin-angiotensin system blockers, and calcium channel blockers have all shown benefit on cardiovascular outcomes in older patients. Given the economic and public health burden of hypertension in the United States and globally, it is critical to address lifestyle modifications in younger generations to prevent hypertension with age.",pubmed

Several studies link cardiovascular diseases (CVD) with unhealthy lifestyles (unhealthy dietary habits, alcohol consumption, smoking, and low levels of physical activity). Therefore, the strong need for CVD prevention may be pursued through an improved control of CVD risk factors (impaired lipid and glycemic profiles, high blood pressure, and obesity), which is achievable through an overall intervention aimed to favor a healthy lifestyle. Focusing on diet, different recommendations emphasize the need to increase or avoid consumption of entire classes of food, with only partly known and only partly foreseeable consequences on the overall level of health. In recent years, the ketogenic diet (KD) has been proposed to be an effective lifestyle intervention for metabolic syndrome, and although the beneficial effects on weight loss and glucose metabolism seems to be well established, the effects of a prolonged KD on the ability to perform different types of exercise and the influence of KD on blood pressure (BP) levels, both in normotensives and in hypertensives, are not so well understood.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of premature death and disability in humans and their incidence is on the rise globally. Given their substantial contribution towards the escalating costs of health care, CVDs also generate a high socio-economic burden in the general population. The underlying pathogenesis and progression associated with nearly all CVDs are predominantly of atherosclerotic origin that leads to the development of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, venous thromboembolism and, peripheral vascular disease, subsequently causing myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias or stroke. The aetiological risk factors leading to the onset of CVDs are well recognized and include hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking and, lack of physical activity. They collectively represent more than 90% of the CVD risks in all epidemiological studies. Despite high fatality rate of CVDs, the identification and careful prevention of the underlying risk factors can significantly reduce the global epidemic of CVDs. Beside making favorable lifestyle modifications, primary regimes for the prevention and treatment of CVDs include lipid-lowering drugs, antihypertensives, antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapies. Despite their effectiveness, significant gaps in the treatment of CVDs remain. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology and pathology of the major CVDs that are prevalent globally. We also determine the contribution of well-recognized risk factors towards the development of CVDs and the prevention strategies. In the end, therapies for the control and treatment of CVDs are discussed.",pubmed

The prevalence of obesity has reached pandemic proportions worldwide and certainly in the United States. Obesity is a well-established independent risk factor for development of many cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including heart failure, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. Therefore, it is logical to expect obesity would have a strong correlation with CVD mortality. However, a substantial body of literature demonstrates a paradox with improved prognosis of overweight and obese patients with established CVD compared to lean patients with the identical CVD. Surprisingly, similar data has also shown that cardiovascular fitness, rather than weight loss alone, influences the relationship between obesity and mortality in those with established CVD. The impact of fitness, exercise, physical activity (PA), and weight loss and their relationship to the obesity paradox are all reviewed here.",pubmed

The most important way to prevent atherosclerotic vascular disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation is to promote a healthy lifestyle throughout life. 2. A team-based care approach is an effective strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Clinicians should evaluate the social determinants of health that affect individuals to inform treatment decisions. 3. Adults who are 40 to 75 years of age and are being evaluated for cardiovascular disease prevention should undergo 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimation and have a clinician–patient risk discussion before starting on pharmacological therapy, such as antihypertensive therapy, a statin, or aspirin. The presence or absence of additional risk-enhancing factors can help guide decisions about preventive interventions in select individuals, as can coronary artery calcium scanning. 4. All adults should consume a healthy diet that emphasizes the intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, lean vegetable or animal protein, and fish and minimizes the intake of <i>trans</i> fats, processed meats, refined carbohydrates, and sweetened beverages. For adults with overweight and obesity, counseling and caloric restriction are recommended for achieving and maintaining weight loss. 5. Adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity. 6. For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lifestyle changes, such as improving dietary habits and achieving exercise recommendations are crucial. If medication is indicated, metformin is first-line therapy, followed by consideration of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. 7. All adults should be assessed at every healthcare visit for tobacco use, and those who use tobacco should be assisted and strongly advised to quit. 8. Aspirin should be used infrequently in the routine primary prevention of ASCVD because of lack of net benefit. 9.

Patients with nonobstructive and stable angina pectoris are usually women. Nonobstructive CAD is caused by endothelial dysfunction at the microvascular level, such as cardiac syndrome X and coronary slow flow syndrome. Even if coronary anatomy is nonobstructive, the presence of myocardial ischemia is a major determinant for the exercise program. CAD is a chronic inflammatory disease, and the progression of the disease can lead to a rapid change in the functional capacity of CAD patients. Exercise training is a major component of cardiac rehabilitation and reduces cardiovascular mortality, morbidity, and rehospitalization as well as improves psychological stress and controls risk factors of CAD, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity. It is possible that the quality of life of patients with CAD can be improved by using appropriate exercise therapy. However, the exercise programs among CAD patients are highly underutilized.

A wealth of clinical and epidemiological evidence has linked obesity to a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, stroke, atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Obesity can increase CVD morbidity and mortality directly and indirectly. Direct effects are mediated by obesity-induced structural and functional adaptations of the cardiovascular system to accommodate excess body weight, as well as by adipokine effects on inflammation and vascular homeostasis. Indirect effects are mediated by co-existing CVD risk factors such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Adipose tissue (AT) quality and functionality are more relevant aspects for cardiometabolic risk than its total amount. The consequences of maladaptive AT expansion in obesity are local and systemic: the local include inflammation, hypoxia, dysregulated adipokine secretion and impaired mitochondrial function; the systemic comprise insulin resistance, abnormal glucose/lipid metabolism, hypertension, a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state and endothelial dysfunction, all of which provide linking mechanisms for the association between obesity and CVD. The present narrative review summarizes the major pathophysiological links between obesity and CVD (traditional and novel concepts), analyses the heterogeneity of obesity-related cardiometabolic consequences, and provides an overview of the cardiovascular impact of weight loss interventions.",pubmed

A sedentary lifestyle, low levels of physical activity and fitness, poor dietary patterns, and psychosocial stress are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Conversely, engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining optimal fitness levels, adhering to a heart-healthy dietary pattern, effectively managing body weight, ensuring adequate sleep, implementing stress-reduction strategies, and addressing psychosocial risk factors are associated with a reduced risk of ASCVD. This comprehensive review synthesizes current evidence from large observational studies and randomized controlled trials on lifestyle factors as determinants of ASCVD health. It also briefly reviews mechanistic insights into how factors such as low shear stress, increased reactive oxygen species production, chronic inflammation, platelets and coagulation activation, endothelial dysfunction, and sympathetic hyperactivity contribute to the initiation and exacerbation of ASCVD risk factors. These include obesity, hyperglycemia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, subsequently leading to the development and progression of atherosclerosis, ultimately resulting in chronic ASCVD or acute cardiovascular events. To bridge the translational gap between epidemiologic and trial-based evidence and clinical practice, practical recommendations are summarized to facilitate the translation of scientific knowledge into actionable interventions to promote ASCVD health. Acknowledged is the gap between the evidence-based knowledge and adoption within healthcare systems, which remains a crucial objective in advancing cardiovascular health at the population level.",pubmed

Obesity is a chronic disease, a major public health problem due to its association with non-communicable diseases and all-cause mortality. Indeed, people with obesity are at increased risk for a variety of obesity-related disorders including hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and several cancers. Many popular diets with very different macronutrient composition, including the Mediterranean diet (MD), have been used, proposed, and studied for prevention and management of obesity. In particular, MD has been the subject of countless studies over the years and now boasts a large body of scientific literature. In this review, we aimed to update current knowledge by summarizing the most recent evidence on the effect of MD on obesity and obesity-related disorders. The negative effects of obesity are partly reversed by substantial weight loss that can be achieved with MD, especially when low-calorie and in combination with adequate physical activity. In addition, the composition of MD has been correlated with an excellent effect on reducing dyslipidemia. It also positively modulates the gut microbiota and immune system, significantly decreasing inflammatory mediators, a common ground for many obesity-related disorders. People with obesity are at increased risk for a variety of medical disorders including hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, there is an inevitable need for measures to manage obesity and its related disorders. At this point, MD has been proposed as a valuable nutritional intervention. It is characterized by a high consumption of vegetables, fruit, nuts, cereals, whole grains, and extra virgin olive oil, as well as a moderate consumption of fish and poultry, and a limited intake of sweets, red meat, and dairy products.

Using the 2015 to March 2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and 2015 to 2019 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we estimated trends in prevalence for cardiovascular risk factors based on adverse levels of Life's Essential 8 and clinical cardiovascular disease and stroke. We projected through 2050, overall and by age and race and ethnicity, accounting for changes in disease prevalence and demographics. We estimate that among adults, prevalence of hypertension will increase from 51.2% in 2020 to 61.0% in 2050. Diabetes (16.3% to 26.8%) and obesity (43.1% to 60.6%) will increase, whereas hypercholesterolemia will decline (45.8% to 24.0%).

As seen for obesity, the past few decades have seen a doubling of the diabetes mellitus incidence with an increasing number of type 2 diabetes mellitus cases being diagnosed in children. Significant racial and ethnic disparities exist in the prevalence and trends of obesity and diabetes mellitus. In general, in both adults and children, non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans seem to be at a high risk than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Secular changes in agricultural policies, diet, food environment, physical activity, and sleep have all contributed to the upward trends in the diabesity epidemic. Despite marginal improvements in physical activity and the US diet, the food environment has changed drastically to an obesogenic one with increased portion sizes and limited access to healthy food choices especially for disadvantaged populations. Interventions that improve the food environment are critical as both obesity and diabetes mellitus raise the risk of cardiovascular disease by ≈2-fold. Among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus, significant sex differences occur in the risk of cardiovascular disease such that diabetes mellitus completely eliminates or attenuates the advantages of being female.

Dyslipidemia, characterized by abnormal blood lipid levels, is a major public health concern due to its association with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and other cardiometabolic disorders. In this context, appropriate nutrition patterns are pivotal as they represent the basic approach for providing a wide range of substantial advantages. The best evidence for dyslipidemia management is offered by the Mediterranean Diet, the Plant-Based Diet, the High-Fiber Diet and the Anti-inflammatory Diet, while the DASH Diet and the Ketogenic Diet have also been shown to target additional pathological features like hypertension and other comorbidities. The bioactive compounds that are enriched in these nutrition patterns and able to manage dyslipidemia include monounsaturated fatty acids such as ω-3, polyphenols such as oleuropein, resveratrol, flavonoids, and catechins, carotenoids, phytosterols and soluble and unsoluble fibers. Diets rich in these compounds can improve lipid profile by mitigating oxidative stress, reducing low-grade chronic inflammation, modulating macronutrient absorption and other mechanisms, thereby supporting cardiovascular health. Additionally, lifestyle interventions such as regular physical activity, weight loss, reduced alcohol consumption and smoking cessation further ameliorate lipid metabolism and manage circulated lipid profile. Furthermore, emerging insights from nutrigenomics underscore the potential for proper diet to address genetic factors and optimize treatment outcomes. The pivotal role of nutrition interventions in the context of dyslipidemia and its cardiometabolic implications is discussed in this review, emphasizing evidence-based and personalized approaches.",pubmed

The aim of this study was to investigate the causal relationship and evidence of an association between increased adiposity and the risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events or mortality. Observational (informing association) and Mendelian randomization (MR) (informing causality) studies were assessed to gather mutually complementary insights and elucidate perplexing epidemiological relationships. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational and MR studies that were published until January 2021 and evaluated the association between obesity-related indices and CVD risk were searched. Twelve systematic reviews with 53 meta-analyses results (including over 501 cohort studies) and 12 MR studies were included in the analysis. A body mass index (BMI) increase was associated with higher risks of coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, all-cause stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic stroke, hypertension, aortic valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism, and venous thrombo-embolism. The MR study results demonstrated a causal effect of obesity on all indices but stroke. The CVD risk increase for every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI varied from 10% [relative risk (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.21; certainty of evidence, low] for haemorrhagic stroke to 49% (RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.40-1.60; certainty of evidence, high) for hypertension. The all-cause and CVD-specific mortality risks increased with adiposity in cohorts, but the MR studies demonstrated no causal effect of adiposity on all-cause mortality. High adiposity is associated with increased CVD risk despite divergent evidence gradients. Adiposity was a causal risk factor for CVD except all-cause mortality and stroke. Half (49%; 26/53) of the associations were supported by high-level evidence. The associations were consistent between sexes and across global regions.

The World Health Organization (WHO) refers to obesity as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a health risk. Obesity was first designated as a disease in 2012 and since then the cost and the burden of the disease have witnessed a worrisome increase. Obesity and hypertension are closely interrelated as abdominal obesity interferes with the endocrine and immune systems and carries a greater risk for insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Many factors are at the interplay between obesity and hypertension. They include hemodynamic alterations, oxidative stress, renal injury, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance, sleep apnea syndrome and the leptin-melanocortin pathway. Genetics, epigenetics, and mitochondrial factors also play a major role. The measurement of blood pressure in obese patients requires an adapted cuff and the search for other secondary causes is necessary at higher thresholds than the general population.

Modifiable risk factors including cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes, poor diet quality, obesity, and physical inactivity, along with underlying genetic factors contribute to lower extremity atherosclerosis. Patients with PAD often have coexistent coronary or cerebrovascular disease, and increased likelihood of major adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. Patients with PAD often have reduced walking capacity and are at risk of acute and chronic critical limb ischemia leading to major adverse limb events, such as peripheral revascularization or amputation. The presence of polyvascular disease identifies the highest risk patient group for major adverse cardiovascular events, and patients with prior critical limb ischemia, prior lower extremity revascularization, or amputation have a heightened risk of major adverse limb events. Medical therapies have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events, and improving function in patients with PAD by modulating key disease determining pathways including inflammation, vascular dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. Treatment with guideline-recommended therapies, including smoking cessation, lipid lowering drugs, optimal glucose control, and antithrombotic medications lowers the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events.

All cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and individual cardiovascular events (stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and unplanned cardiovascular interventions). Pairs of reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A random effects network meta-analysis was performed using a frequentist approach and grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) methods to determine the certainty of evidence for each outcome. 40 eligible trials were identified with 35 548 participants across seven named dietary programmes (low fat, 18 studies; Mediterranean, 12; very low fat, 6; modified fat, 4; combined low fat and low sodium, 3; Ornish, 3; Pritikin, 1). At last reported follow-up, based on moderate certainty evidence, Mediterranean dietary programmes proved superior to minimal intervention for the prevention of all cause mortality (odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 0.92; patients at intermediate risk: risk difference 17 fewer per 1000 followed over five years), cardiovascular mortality (0.55, 0.39 to 0.78; 13 fewer per 1000), stroke (0.65, 0.46 to 0.93; 7 fewer per 1000), and non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.48, 0.36 to 0.65; 17 fewer per 1000). Based on moderate certainty evidence, low fat programmes proved superior to minimal intervention for prevention of all cause mortality (0.84, 0.74 to 0.95; 9 fewer per 1000) and non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.77, 0.61 to 0.96; 7 fewer per 1000). The absolute effects for both dietary programmes were more pronounced for patients at high risk. There were no convincing differences between Mediterranean and low fat programmes for mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction. The five remaining dietary programmes generally had little or no benefit compared with minimal intervention typically based on low to moderate certainty evidence. Moderate certainty evidence shows that programmes promoting Mediterranean and low fat diets, with or without physical activity or other interventions, reduce all cause mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients with increased cardiovascular risk. Mediterranean programmes are also likely to reduce stroke risk. Generally, other named dietary programmes were not superior to minimal intervention. PROSPERO CRD42016047939.",pubmed

Obesity rates have surged to pandemic levels, placing tremendous burden on our society. This chronic and complex disease is related to the development of many life-threatening illnesses including cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension caused by obesity increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity by promoting stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and end-stage renal disease. Overwhelming evidence supports neural origins for obesity-induced hypertension and pinpoints the adipose-derived hormone, leptin, and the sympathetic nervous system as major causal factors. Hyperleptinemia in obesity is associated with selective leptin resistance where leptin's renal sympathoexcitatory and pressor effects are preserved while the metabolic actions are impaired. Understanding the mechanisms driving this phenomenon is critical for developing effective therapeutics. This review describes the neural mechanisms of obesity-induced hypertension with a focus on the molecular and neuronal substrates of leptin action.",pubmed

Thus, there is a growing necessity of improving a personalized nutrition to treat obesity and associated medical conditions, taking into account the interactions between diet, genes and health. Therefore, the knowledge of the interactions between the genome and nutrients at the molecular level, has led to the advent of nutritional genomics, which involves the sciences of nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics.

Genetic mutations cause a small proportion (1-2%) of early-onset AD, with mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2). Major contributing factors of late-onset AD are ApoE4 genotype, traumatic brain injury, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular conditions, in addition to lifestyle factors, such as unhealthy diet and lack of physical exercise. Disease progression can be delayed and/or prevented to a greater extent by adopting healthy lifestyle with balanced and antioxidant enriched diet and daily exercise. The interaction and interplay of diet, exercise, age, and pharmacological interventions holds a crucial role in the progression, pathogenesis and management of AD and its comorbidities, including diabetes, obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular conditions. Antioxidant enriched diet contributes to brain health, glucose control, weight management, and cardiovascular well-being. Regular exercise removes toxins including free radicals and enhances insulin sensitivity, and supports cardiovascular function.

The epidemic of obesity contributes to the burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the United States and worldwide. Importantly, obesity is not only preventable but can be treated, particularly with lifestyle modifications to forestall T2DM in those with excess adiposity. The mechanisms linking obesity to T2DM are numerous and involve adipose tissue remodeling as a result of unhealthy behaviors, including unhealthy diet, reduced physical activity (PA) and exercise training (ET), and increased sedentary behaviors. Taken together, these factors markedly reduce cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), one of the strongest predictors for cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality in the general population, but also in those with T2DM. In this review we describe the mechanisms leading to adipose tissue remodeling resulting in obesity, as well as the mechanisms linking excess adiposity to insulin resistance and, in turn, T2DM. We then present the therapeutic strategies that can be implemented in obesity to prevent T2DM, with a brief discussion on weight loss, and greater emphasis on PA and ET. We finally present the evidence to support the beneficial effects of such strategies in patients with established T2DM and discuss the importance of achieving improvements in CRF in this population to potentially improve clinical outcomes.",pubmed

We aimed to evaluate the impacts of metabolomic body mass index (metBMI) phenotypes on the risks of cardiovascular and ocular diseases outcomes. This study included cohorts in UK and Guangzhou, China. By leveraging the serum metabolome and BMI data from UK Biobank, this study developed and validated a metBMI prediction model using a ridge regression model among 89,830 participants based on 249 metabolites. Five obesity phenotypes were obtained by metBMI and actual BMI (actBMI): normal weight (NW, metBMI of 18.5-24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight (OW, metBMI of 25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), obesity (OB, metBMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overestimated (OE, metBMI-actBMI > 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and underestimated (UE, metBMI-actBMI < - 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Additional participants from the Guangzhou Diabetes Eye Study (GDES) were included for validating the hypothesis. Outcomes included all-cause and cardiovascular (CVD)-cause mortality, as well as incident CVD (coronary heart disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction [MI], and stroke) and age-related eye diseases (age-related macular degeneration [AMD], cataracts, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy [DR]). In the UKB, although OE group had lower actBMI than NW group, the OE group had a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality than those in NW prediction group (HR, 1.68; 95% CI 1.16-2.43). Similarly, the OE group had a 1.7-3.6-fold higher risk than their NW counterparts for cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and coronary heart disease (all P < 0.05). In addition, risk of age-related macular denegation (HR, 1.96; 95% CI 1.02-3.77) was significantly higher in OE group. In the contrast, UE and OB groups showed similar risks of mortality and of cardiovascular and age-related eye diseases (all P > 0.05), though the UE group had significantly higher actBMI than OB group. In the GDES cohort, we further confirmed the potential of metabolic BMI (metBMI) fingerprints for risk stratification of cardiovascular diseases using a different metabolomic approach. Gaps of metBMI and actBMI identified novel metabolic subtypes, which exhibit distinctive cardiovascular and ocular risk profiles. The groups carrying obesity-related metabolites were at higher risk of mortality and morbidity than those with normal health metabolites.

Currently, many studies on irisin are being conducted with respect to physiological functions for health promotion, and the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of chronic diseases, as well as mechanisms associated with improving energy metabolic balance, enhancing cellular homeostasis by optimizing autophagy, promoting mitochondrial quality control, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitigating inflammatory responses.

Fibrinogen conversion into insoluble fibrin and the formation of a stable clot is the final step of the coagulation cascade. Fibrin clot porosity and its susceptibility to plasmin-mediated lysis are the key fibrin measures, describing the properties of clots prepared ex vivo from citrated plasma. Cardiovascular disease (CVD), referring to coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and hypertension, has been shown to be associated with the formation of dense fibrin networks that are relatively resistant to lysis. Denser fibrin mesh characterized acute patients at the onset of myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, while hypofibrinolysis has been identified as a persistent fibrin feature in patients following thrombotic events or in those with stable coronary artery disease. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, obesity, and hypertension, have also been linked with unfavourably altered fibrin clot properties, while some lifestyle modifications and pharmacological treatment, in particular statins and anticoagulants, may improve fibrin structure and function. Prospective studies have suggested that prothrombotic fibrin clot phenotype can predict cardiovascular events in short- and long-term follow-ups. Mutations and splice variants of the fibrinogen molecule that have been proved to be associated with thrombophilia or increased cardiovascular risk, along with fibrinogen post-translational modifications, prothrombotic state, inflammation, platelet activation, and neutrophil extracellular traps formation, contribute also to prothrombotic fibrin clot phenotype. Moreover, about 500 clot-bound proteins have been identified within plasma fibrin clots, including fibronectin, α2-antiplasmin, factor XIII, complement component C3, and histidine-rich glycoprotein.

Recommendations for physical activity in patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD) are based on modest evidence. The authors analyzed the association between self-reported exercise and mortality in patients with stable CHD. A total of 15,486 patients from 39 countries with stable CHD who participated in the STABILITY (Stabilization of Atherosclerotic Plaque by Initiation of Darapladib Therapy) study completed questions at baseline on hours spent each week taking mild, moderate, and vigorous exercise. Associations between the volume of habitual exercise in metabolic equivalents of task hours/week and adverse outcomes during a median follow-up of 3.7 years were evaluated. A graded decrease in mortality occurred with increased habitual exercise that was steeper at lower compared with higher exercise levels. Doubling exercise volume was associated with lower all-cause mortality (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79 to 0.85; adjusting for covariates, HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.93). These associations were similar for cardiovascular mortality (unadjusted HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.80 to 0.87; adjusted HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.96), but myocardial infarction and stroke were not associated with exercise volume after adjusting for covariates. The association between decrease in mortality and greater physical activity was stronger in the subgroup of patients at higher risk estimated by the ABC-CHD (Age, Biomarkers, Clinical-Coronary Heart Disease) risk score (p for interaction = 0.0007).

Hypertension is a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the most common chronic condition seen by family physicians. Treatment of hypertension reduces morbidity and mortality due to coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. The use of ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring improves diagnostic accuracy. Assessment of adults with hypertension should focus on identifying complications of the condition and comorbid cardiovascular risk factors. Physicians should counsel all patients with elevated blood pressure about effective lifestyle interventions, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, dietary sodium restriction, potassium enrichment, regular exercise, weight loss, and moderation of alcohol consumption. First-line antihypertensive medications include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. Thresholds for pharmacologic intervention and blood pressure goals differ according to various guidelines. Evidence strongly supports reducing blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg to reduce the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in adults with hypertension. Lowering blood pressure to less than 135/85 mm Hg may further reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. Clinical judgment and shared decision-making should guide treatment of patients with mild hypertension and older adults who may be more susceptible to adverse effects of antihypertensive medications and tight blood pressure control.",pubmed

Cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) is becoming increasingly common in patients with hypertension, and it is well established that healthy lifestyle plays a key role in the prevention of hypertension. However, the association between combined lifestyle factors and CMM in patients with hypertension is uncertain. This prospective analysis included the data (obtained from the UK biobank) of participants with hypertension who did not have coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, or diabetes. The outcome was the occurrence of CMM, defined as ≥ 1 disease of CHD, stroke, and diabetes that occurred in participants with hypertension. Four lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical activity) were assessed using a weighted healthy lifestyle score, and participants were divided into four groups: the very unhealthy, unhealthy, healthy, and very healthy groups. The flexible parameter Royston-Parmar proportional hazard model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) between lifestyles and CMM, as well as the difference in CMM-free life expectancy. During a median follow-up of 12.2 years, 9812 (18.4%) of the 53,397 hypertensive patients occurred CMM. Compared with the very unhealthy group, the very healthy group had a 41% reduction in the risk for CMM in hypertensive patients and a 32-50% reduction in the risk for specific cardiometabolic diseases such as CHD, stroke, and diabetes. For each lifestyle factor, non-smoking had the greatest protective effect against CMM (HR: 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60-0.68). A lifestyle combining multiple healthy factors extended CMM-free life expectancy (e.g., six years longer at age 45 years for participants in the very healthy group). Combined healthy lifestyle factors were associated with a lower risk for CMM in hypertensive patients.

Thus, the purpose of this systematic review was to provide an update on the association between PA and onset of obesity, CHD, diabetes and hypertension in individuals aged ≥18 years who were free of the respective conditions at baseline. We systematically searched OVID, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases for pertinent literature published between January of 2012 and February of 2019. To ensure that conclusions are based on high quality evidence, we only included longitudinal studies conducted in samples of ≥500 participants and with ≥5 years of follow-up. The search yielded 8929 records of which 26 were included in this review. Three studies were conducted on the outcome of incident obesity, eight on incident CHD, nine on incident diabetes, four on incident hypertension, one on the outcome of both diabetes and hypertension, and one on the outcome of CHD, diabetes and hypertension. Overall, there was an association between PA and lower risk of incident obesity, CHD and diabetes, but not hypertension. Higher levels or amount of PA were associated with a reduced risk of new onset of the respective diseases in 20 studies (77%). Whereas four studies reported an elevated risk of incidence of diseases with lower PA levels (15%). PA was not associated with incidence of diseases in two studies (8%). Higher levels of PA are likely associated with a lower risk of becoming obese, develop CHD or diabetes. These findings replicate and strengthen conclusions from earlier reviews underlining the importance of promoting PA in adults.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and renal diseases in the United States and worldwide. Obesity accounts for much of the risk for primary hypertension through several mechanisms, including neurohormonal activation, inflammation, and kidney dysfunction. As the prevalence of obesity continues to increase, hypertension and associated cardiorenal diseases will also increase unless more effective strategies to prevent and treat obesity are developed. Lifestyle modification, including diet, reduced sedentariness, and increased physical activity, is usually recommended for patients with obesity; however, the long-term success of these strategies for reducing adiposity, maintaining weight loss, and reducing blood pressure has been limited. Effective pharmacotherapeutic and procedural strategies, including metabolic surgeries, are additional options to treat obesity and prevent or attenuate obesity hypertension, target organ damage, and subsequent disease. Medications can be useful for short- and long-term obesity treatment; however, prescription of these drugs is limited. Metabolic surgery is effective for producing sustained weight loss and for treating hypertension and metabolic disorders in many patients with severe obesity. Unanswered questions remain related to the mechanisms of obesity-related diseases, long-term efficacy of different treatment and prevention strategies, and timing of these interventions to prevent obesity and hypertension-mediated target organ damage.

OSA is associated with repetitive episodes of altered blood gases, arousals, large negative swings in intrathoracic pressures, and increased sympathetic activity.

Physical inactivity has contributed to the rising prevalence of hypertension, but patients who exercise or engage in physical activity reduce their risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality. Hence, current international guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention provide generic advice to increase aerobic activity, but physiological responses differ with blood pressure (BP) level, and greater reductions in BP across a population may be achievable with more personalized advice. We performed a systematic review of meta-analyses to determine whether there was sufficient evidence for a scientific Consensus Document reporting how exercise prescription could be personalized for BP control. The document discusses the findings of 34 meta-analyses on BP-lowering effects of aerobic endurance training, dynamic resistance training as well as isometric resistance training in patients with hypertension, high-normal, and individuals with normal BP. As a main finding, there was sufficient evidence from the meta-review, based on the estimated range of exercise-induced BP reduction, the number of randomized controlled trials, and the quality score, to propose that type of exercise can be prescribed according to initial BP level, although considerable research gaps remain. Therefore, this evidence-based Consensus Document proposes further work to encourage and develop more frequent use of personalized exercise prescription to optimize lifestyle interventions for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.",pubmed

These data, plus the well-documented anti-aging effects of exercise, have likely contributed to the escalating numbers of adults who have embraced the notion that ""more exercise is better."" As a result, worldwide participation in endurance training, competitive long distance endurance events, and high-intensity interval training has increased markedly since the previous American Heart Association statement on exercise risk. On the other hand, vigorous physical activity, particularly when performed by unfit individuals, can acutely increase the risk of sudden cardiac death and acute myocardial infarction in susceptible people.

We investigated whether adherence to healthy plant-foods-rich dietary patterns might attenuate risks of obesity and related cardiovascular abnormalities for people at genetically higher risk of obesity. This study included 121,799 middle-aged adults in UK Biobank who were initially free of metabolic diseases and cancer. We calculated a healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) based on 17 major food groups as well as a genetic risk score (GRS) for obesity consisting of body mass index (BMI)-associated variants. The incidence of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, MI, or stroke) was prospectively followed during a mean (SD) 5.1 (0.9) years. We found significant interactions between GRS and hPDI on adiposity (P<sub>interaction</sub> <0.0001); adherence to hPDI was more strongly associated with lower levels of adiposity among participants with higher GRS than those with lower GRS. Further, we found a similar pattern of GRS-hPDI interactions on untreated hypertension (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.0036). When we tested GRS-hPDI interactions on cardiovascular events, adherence to hPDI was more strongly associated with a decreased risk of MI among people with high GRS (above median) than those with low GRS (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.006). Among participants with high GRS, high adherence to hPDI (the top tertile of hPDI) was associated with an HR 0.54 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.74) for MI, as compared to low adherence.

Combined results were pooled from two independent ED genome-wide association studies to verify the findings. Genetically predicted body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, trunk fat mass, whole body fat mass, poor overall health rating, type 2 diabetes, basal metabolic rate, adiponectin, cigarette consumption, insomnia, snoring, hypertension, stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and major depressive disorder were found to increase the risk of ED (all P < 0.05). Additionally, genetic liability to higher body fat percentage and alcohol consumption were suggestively associated with an increased risk of ED (P < 0.05 and adjusted P > 0.05). Genetic predisposition to higher sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels could decrease the risk of ED (P < 0.05). No significant association was detected between lipid levels and ED. Multivariate MR identified type 2 diabetes, basal metabolic rate, cigarette consumption, hypertension, and coronary heart disease as risk factors for ED. The combined results confirmed that waist circumference, whole body fat mass, poor overall health rating, type 2 diabetes, basal metabolic rate, adiponectin, cigarette consumption, snoring, hypertension, ischemic stroke, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and major depressive disorder could increase the risk of ED (all P < 0.05), while higher SHBG decreased the risk of ED (P = 0.004). There were suggestive significances of BMI, insomnia, and stroke on ED (P < 0.05 and adjusted P > 0.05). This comprehensive MR study supported the causal role of obesity, type 2 diabetes, basal metabolic rate, poor self-health rating, cigarette and alcohol consumption, insomnia and snoring, depression, hypertension, stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, SHBG, and adiponectin in the onset and development of ED.",pubmed

Obesity is increasingly more common in postindustrial societies, and the burden of childhood obesity is increasing. The major effects of obesity on cardiovascular (CV) health are mediated through the risk of metabolic syndrome (insulin-resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension), such that an absence of these risk factors in obese individuals may not be associated with increased mortality risk. In individuals already diagnosed with chronic CV disease (CVD), the overweight and class I obese have significant associations with improved survival. However, this effect is attenuated by increases in cardiorespiratory fitness. The negative effects of obesity on CV health manifest as accelerated progression of atherosclerosis, higher rates of ventricular remodeling and a higher risk of associated diseases, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. The most effective therapies at reversing CVD risk factors associated with obesity have been dietary changes with exercise, especially through structured exercise programs, such as cardiac rehabilitation.",pubmed

Fourteen systematic reviews consisting of 23 meta-analyses, and 11 Mendelian randomization (MR) studies were included in this study. Short sleep duration was associated with a higher risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, stroke, and coronary heart disease (CHD) in observational studies, while a causal role was only demonstrated in obesity, hypertension, and CHD by MR. Similarly, long sleep duration showed connections with a higher risk of obesity, T2D, hypertension, stroke, and CHD in observational studies, none was supported by MR analysis. Both observational and MR studies indicated heightened risks of hypertension, stroke, and CHD in relation to insomnia. Napping was linked to elevated risks of T2D and CHD in observational studies, with MR analysis confirming a causal role in T2D.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death in the US. Known modifiable risk factors for CVD include smoking, overweight and obesity, diabetes, elevated blood pressure or hypertension, dyslipidemia, lack of physical activity, and unhealthy diet. Adults who adhere to national guidelines for a healthy diet and physical activity have lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than those who do not. All persons, regardless of their CVD risk status, benefit from healthy eating behaviors and appropriate physical activity. To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet and physical activity for CVD prevention in adults with cardiovascular risk factors. This recommendation statement applies to adults 18 years or older with known hypertension or elevated blood pressure, those with dyslipidemia, or those who have mixed or multiple risk factors such as metabolic syndrome or an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% or greater. Adults with other known modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as abnormal blood glucose levels, obesity, and smoking are not included in this recommendation. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that behavioral counseling interventions have a moderate net benefit on CVD risk in adults at increased risk for CVD. The USPSTF recommends offering or referring adults with CVD risk factors to behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet and physical activity. (B recommendation).",pubmed

This study aimed to examine the independent and joint associations between SSB or ASB consumption and physical activity and risk of CVD, defined as fatal and nonfatal coronary artery disease and stroke, in adults from 2 United States-based prospective cohort studies. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs between SSB or ASB intake and physical activity with incident CVD among 65,730 females in the Nurses' Health Study (1980-2016) and 39,418 males in the Health Professional's Follow-up Study (1986-2016), who were free from chronic diseases at baseline. SSBs and ASBs were assessed every 4-y and physical activity biannually. A total of 13,269 CVD events were ascertained during 3,001,213 person-years of follow-up. Compared with those who never/rarely consumed SSBs or ASBs, the HR for CVD for participants consuming ≥2 servings/d was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.32; P-trend < 0.001) for SSBs and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.09; P-trend = 0.06) for those consuming ≥2 servings/d of ASBs.

UA acts as an antioxidant and it accounts for 50% of the total antioxidant capacity of biological fluids in humans. When present in cytoplasm of the cells or in acidic/hydrophobic milieu in atherosclerotic plaques, UA converts into a pro-oxidant agent and promotes oxidative stress and through this mechanism participates in the pathophysiology of human disease including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most epidemiological studies but not all of them suggested the existence of an association between elevated serum UA level and CVD, including coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, congestive heart failure, arterial hypertension and atrial fibrillation as well as an increased risk for mortality due to CVD in general population and subjects with confirmed CHD. Evidence available also suggests an association between elevated UA and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease. Experimental and clinical studies have evidenced several mechanisms through which elevated UA level exerts deleterious effects on cardiovascular health including increased oxidative stress, reduced availability of nitric oxide and endothelial dysfunction, promotion of local and systemic inflammation, vasoconstriction and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation. Although the causality in the relationship between UA and CVD remains unproven, UA may be pathogenic and participate in the pathophysiology of CVD by serving as a bridging mechanism mediating (enabling) or potentiating the deleterious effects of cardiovascular risk factors on vascular tissue and myocardium.",pubmed

Intensive research has elucidated the role of diet in cardiovascular disease and has led to public health policies focusing on educating the population on the role of nutrition in cardiovascular health. Compelling evidence shows that a healthy diet, rich in fruit and vegetables with moderate consumption of fish and a low consumption of animal by-products and processed foods, decreases low-grade inflammation and oxidation, leukocyte activation, platelet aggregation and microparticle shedding.

Plausible biological reasons suggest that exercise would be important in preventing stroke. While definitive randomised controlled trials evaluating the impact of physical activity (PA) and exercise on preventing stroke and mortality are lacking, observational studies, small randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses have provided evidence that PA and exercise favourably modify stroke risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, excessive alcohol consumption and tobacco use. It is, therefore, important to understand the factors associated with poststroke PA/exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness. Positively associated factors include self-efficacy, social support and quality of patients' relationships with health professionals. Negatively associated factors include logistical barriers, medical comorbidities, stroke-related deficits, negative exercise beliefs, fear of falling, poststroke fatigue, arthropathy/pain and depression. Definitive research is needed to specify efficacious behavioural approaches to increase poststroke exercise. Effective techniques probably include physician endorsement of exercise programmesto patients, enhancement of patient-professional relationships, providing patients an exercise rationale, motivational interviewing, collaborative goal-setting with patients, addressing logistical concerns, social support in programsmes, structured exercise programming, individualised behavioural instruction, behavioural diary recording, reviewing behavioural consequences of exercise efforts, reinforcing successful exercise performance. Exercise programming without counselling may increase short-term activity; simple advice or information-giving is probably ineffective. Older patients or those with cognitive impairment may need increased structure, with emphasis on behaviour per se, versus self-regulation skills.

Vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA) refers to brief bouts of intense physical activity embedded into daily life. To examine sex differences in the dose-response association of VILPA with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and its subtypes. Using multivariable-adjusted cubic splines, we examined the associations of daily VILPA duration with overall MACE and its subtypes (incident myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke) among non-exercisers (individuals self-reporting no leisure-time exercise and no more than one recreational walk per week) in the UK Biobank. We also undertook analogous analyses for vigorous physical activity among exercisers (individuals self-reporting participation in leisure-time exercise and/or recreational walking more than once a week). Among 13 018 women and 9350 men, there were 331 and 488 all MACE, respectively, over a 7.9-year follow-up. In women, daily VILPA duration exhibited a near-linear dose-response association with all MACE, myocardial infarction and heart failure. In men, dose-reponse curves were less clear with less evidence of statistical signifigance. Compared with women with no VILPA, women's median daily VILPA duration of 3.4 min was associated with hazard ratios (HRs; 95% confidence intervals) of 0.55 (0.41 to 0.75) for all MACE and 0.33 (0.18 to 0.59) for heart failure.

The study measured leisure-time sedentary behaviors (watching TV, using a computer, and driving) and physical activities (walking for pleasure, light and heavy do-it-yourself activities, strenuous sports, and other exercises) in terms of frequency and duration over the 4 weeks before assessment. Both a Cox proportional hazard model and an isotemporal substitution model were utilized in the study to assess the association between leisure sedentary behavior, physical activities, and CVD risk. During a median 12.5 years of follow-up, 26 355 CVD cases were reported, including 19 746 coronary heart disease, 4836 stroke, and 7398 heart failure cases. High physical activity levels were linked to a significantly lower risk of CVD (21%), coronary heart disease (20%), stroke (15%), and heart failure (31%). In contrast, individuals with >6.5 h/d of sedentary behavior faced a 16% to 21% higher risk of these conditions compared with those with ≤3.5 h/d. Notably, replacing 30 minutes of inactivity with physical activity reduced CVD risks by 3% to 16%, particularly with strenuous sports. A significant interaction was observed between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and genetic predisposition in relation to stroke risk. Among patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, higher leisure-time physical activity levels correlate with reduced CVD risks, while increased sedentary behavior is linked to higher CVD risks. Replacing sedentary time with physical activity consistently shows benefits in reducing CVD outcomes, irrespective of genetic predisposition.",pubmed

Hypertension is one of the most challenging health problems inducing cerebrovascular disease and high percentage of death when associated with diabetes, dyslipidemias, and obesity. Orexin/hypocretin is a peptide expressed by a small number of neurons of the dorsolateral hypothalamus, a brain feeding and autonomic ""fight-or-flight"" regulatory center. According to this function, orexin has been demonstrated to evoke cardiovascular responses, heart rate, hypertension, hyperarousal, hyperphagia, and obesity. The focus of this review is to provide an overview about the mechanism through which orexin regulates food intake and cardiovascular responses and its role in the pathogenesis of obesity and hypertension which could be of great interest to establish possible new therapies. In normal rats and mice, central administration of orexin increases food intake, blood pressure, and sympathetic nerve activity and these effects are blocked by selective orexin receptor antagonist SB-334867 or almorexant. Moreover, upregulation of orexin signaling, in combination with elevation of epinephrine and norepinephrine circulating levels, occurs in rats exposed to chronic stress, in models of spontaneous hypertension (SHR and BPH/2J Schlager mice) and in obese mice (ob/ob or mice fed with high fat diet). Therefore, hyperactivity of orexinergic neurons could be a factor in the development of obesity and essential hypertension. Because of their widespread projections to the brain regions involved in appetite and cardiovascular responses, as far down as sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord, orexin evokes sympathetically mediated cardiovascular responses. Lasting upregulation of orexin signaling can lead to hyperphagia, obesity, and hypertensive state. Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) and selective orexin receptor antagonists (SORAs) have antihypertensive effects that could be of clinical use for regulation of food intake and hypertension, supporting the role of orexinergic neurons as critical checkpoint in the neurogenic control of metabolic and cardiovascular functions.",pubmed

The prevalence of obesity in childhood is high and continues to increase globally. It is currently estimated that 381 million children worldwide have overweight or obesity. This disease stems from multiple complex pathways that can present early in life. This is particularly concerning because childhood obesity is associated with cardiovascular risk factors that can lead to early atherosclerosis and premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertension, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and systemic inflammation are associated with vascular changes in childhood, and these contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular events in adulthood if not adequately treated. Interventions to treat childhood obesity include multicomponent family-based behaviour modification programs, which have been demonstrated to have moderate short-term effects on weight-related outcomes; their effects on cardiovascular risk factors, however, are less well understood. Although supervised, structured exercise interventions result in improvements in blood pressure, inflammation, carotid artery intima media thickness, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and endothelial dysfunction in children with obesity in the short term, our understanding of how to translate these interventions into long-term sustainable exercise or physical activity recommendations remains uncertain.

Physical activity is an effective modifiable behavior for preventing recurrent strokes. This study aims to determine the adherence to physical activity recommendations among stroke survivors in the United States. We further compared our findings with the adherence observed among myocardial infarction (MI) survivors and healthy adults, each assessed against distinct physical activity guidelines specific to their respective populations. We utilized data from the 2011 to 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a nationally representative survey. To establish benchmarks for stroke survivors, we referenced 3 different physical activity recommendations outlined in 2011, 2014, and 2021 American Heart Association stroke prevention guidelines. Similarly, for MI survivors and healthy adults, we used the 2011 guidelines for secondary prevention of coronary vascular diseases and the 2020 World Health Organization physical activity guidelines, respectively. Adherence to recommendations was determined by the respondents' self-reported intensity, duration, and frequency of physical activity. Multivariate logistic regression compared adherence in stroke survivors, MI survivors, and healthy adults. Among 48 222 stroke survivors in the United States, the overall adherence rates to 2011, 2014, and 2021 physical activity guidelines were 75.4%, 40.2%, and 69.2%. For independently mobile stroke survivors, the adherence rates increased to 78.1%, 42.1%, and 69.9%. Among MI survivors and healthy adults, the adherence rates were 42.7% and 72%. When 2021 recommendations were used as a benchmark, older (aged ≥65 years) stroke survivors were more likely to adhere to recommendations than younger survivors (71.9% versus 62.3%; <i>P</i><0.0001). After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities, non-Hispanic Black survivors were less likely to adhere to recommendations (adjusted odds ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.7-0.94]), whereas older and higher educated stroke survivors were more likely to adhere to recommendations. Geographically, stroke belt and nonrural residents were less likely to adhere to recommendations ([63.5% versus 67.9%; <i>P</i><0.0001]; [53.8% versus 58.7%; <i>P</i><0.0001]).

Dyslipidemia is the foundation of atherosclerotic buildup and lipoproteins serve as cofactors to the inflammatory processes that destabilize plaques. Increasing cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength helps attenuate concentrations of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), such as LDL cholesterol, and increase levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as reduce proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 expression.

Obesity has recently emerged as one of the most severe health concerns. Obesity is a key autonomous risk factor for heart failure and contributes to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic abnormalities. Obesity is caused by a metabolic imbalance, which occurs when calories burnt are fewer than the number of calories consumed. There are several pathways accountable for the adverse impacts of obesity on the cardiovascular system. Inflammatory cell infiltration develops in the adipose tissue, the pancreas, and other issues similar to the progression of obesity. Inflammation is triggered by immune cells that invade dysfunctional adipose tissue. The atherosclerotic inflammation phase, related to obesity, induces coronary calcification. Obesity is linked to elevated levels of leptin and high blood pressure. Leptin causes systemic vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and increased blood pressure by influencing the synthesis of nitric oxide and activating the sympathetic nervous system. Obesity is a well-known risk factor for CVD and is one of the leading causes of the greater risk of diseases, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, depression, metabolic syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure in adults and children. When used with dietary improvements, antiobesity drugs improve the probability of experiencing clinically healthy (5%) weight loss.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a comprehensive lifestyle program that can have particular benefit for older patients with cardiovascular conditions. Although CR was originally designed primarily as an exercise training program for younger adults after a myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass surgery, it has evolved as a comprehensive lifestyle program (promoting physical activity as well as education, diet, risk reduction, and adherence) for a broader range of CVD (coronary heart disease, heart failure, and valvular heart disease). It provides a valuable opportunity to address and moderate many of the challenges pertinent for the large and growing population of older adults with CVD. Cardiac rehabilitation promotes physical function (cardiorespiratory fitness as well as strength and balance) that helps overcome disease and deconditioning as well as related vulnerabilities such as disability, frailty, and falls.

Obesity is a major global health problem, and its multisystem effects are inextricably linked with elevated cardiovascular risk and adverse outcomes. The cardiovascular benefits of reversing obesity in adults are well-established. Compared with other weight-loss strategies, programmes that incorporate bariatric surgery for weight loss are beneficial for sustained BMI reduction. A marked improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, inflammation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, has been observed after bariatric surgery. This broad improvement in cardiovascular risk profile has led to substantial reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. As with all procedures, the benefits of bariatric surgery must be weighed against its potential risks. Modern bariatric surgery has an excellent safety profile, but important limitations remain, including the potential for surgical complications and nutritional deficiencies, and the lifelong requirement for nutritional supplementation. Surgery should be considered in patients with severe obesity, especially those with cardiovascular comorbidities. In this Review, we summarize the current management options for patients with obesity, and discuss the effects of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes.",pubmed

More than 10.74 million people are currently held in penal institutions worldwide. Moreover, there is also evidence that the percentage of elder and female prisoners has been consistently growing. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Exercise training and physical activity help to prevent both primary and secondary cardiovascular events. Data on the influence of physical activity on the well-being in prison population is scarce. Here, we discussed, in a systematic review, the general health conditions and the cardiovascular risk profile in the prisoners compared to the general population and evaluated whether or not exercise could be a valuable tool in preventing these diseases in inmates. We performed a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement: 769 were initially identified, and a total of 24 studies were finally included. Nine studies evaluated the health conditions in prisoners, five studies evaluated the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) in the prison population, and 10 studies evaluated the feasibility and the effectiveness of exercise programs in prisoners. Sports-educational programs can benefit prison inmates. It appears that supervised exercise training is an effective coping strategy to deal with incarceration.

Physical activity is an important non-drug-related method to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases, but how exercise duration affects the cardiovascular metabolic risk factors in adults remains uncertain. This review systematically examines the time-dependent effects of physical activity on cardiovascular risk factors in adults and aims to further the understanding of the temporal therapeutics of exercise. Following the PRISMA guidelines, the PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and CNKI databases were systematically searched for relevant scientific studies from January 2000 to June 2022. A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. The sample size ranged from 11-275 participants who were diagnosed with obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM), and Coronary Heart Disease (CAD), while the subjects in four studies did not report any metabolic or cardiovascular disease. Four studies conducted trials of acute exercise interventions, while the remaining intervention periods ranged from 12 days to 12 weeks. The exercise interventions included aerobic training, resistance training, aerobic training that was combined with resistance training, compound exercise, and high-intensity interval exercise, and the training frequency varied from 2-5 times/week. Overall, this review found some evidence that the cardiovascular risk factors in adults may be time-dependent in response to physical activity. However, it is limited by the small sample size for each of the outcomes and several methodological issues, leading to poor comparability between studies. A randomized controlled trial with a larger sample size is supposed to be designed for the relevant population to completely test whether synchronizing the exercise time point in the day with the individual's circadian rhythm can amplify the benefits of the exercise for improving cardiovascular health.",pubmed

Major risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) include hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome; all of which are considered inflammatory conditions. Women are disproportionately affected by inflammatory conditions, with sex differences emerging as early as adolescence. Hormonal fluctuations associated with reproductive events such as menarche, pregnancy and menopause, are hypothesized to promote a pro-inflammatory state in women. Moreover, women who have experienced inflammatory-type conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia, have a cardiometabolic phenotype that pre-disposes to increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and coronary heart disease. Women with no notable CVD risk factors are often relatively protected from CVD pre-menopause; but overtake men in risk of major cardiovascular events when the cardiovascular protective effects of oestrogen begin to wane. Sex differences and female-specific factors have long been considered challenging to study and this has led to an underrepresentation of females in clinical trials and lack of female-specific data from pre-clinical studies. However, there is now a clear prerogative to include females at all stages of research, despite inherent complexities and potential variability in data.

Physical activity has profound impacts on the vasculature in humans. Acute exercise induces immediate changes in artery function, whereas repeated episodic bouts of exercise induce chronic functional adaptation and, ultimately, structural arterial remodeling. The nature of these changes in function and structure are dependent on the characteristics of the training load and may be modulated by other factors such as exercise-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. The clinical implications of these physiological adaptations are profound. Exercise impacts on the development of atherosclerosis and on the incidence of primary and secondary cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Exercise also plays a role in the amelioration of other chronic diseases that possess a vascular etiology, including diabetes and dementia. The mechanisms responsible for these effects of exercise on the vasculature are both primary and secondary in nature, in that the benefits conferred by changes in cardiovascular risk factors such as lipid profiles and blood pressure occur in concert with direct effects of arterial shear stress and mechanotransduction.

To investigate the role of MVD and CVHMs in the development of CHD among T2DM. We included 19 664 participants with T2DM from the UK Biobank who had CVHM data and were free of CHD during recruitment. CVHMs were defined based on 5 behavioral (body mass index, diet, sleep duration, smoking, and regular exercise) and 3 biological (glycemic control, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension) factors. MVD was defined as the presence of retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, or chronic kidney disease. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI of CHD were estimated by multivariable Cox regression models. There were 3252 incident cases of CHD recorded after a median follow-up of 12.3 years. After multivariable adjustment, each MVD was separately associated with risk of CHD, and those who had 1 or ≥ 2 MVD had a 27% and an 87% increased risk of developing CHD, respectively. Each unfavorable CVHM was associated with a higher risk of CHD.

In this article, we discuss certain contemporary and controversial topics in cardiovascular (CV) nutrition including recent data regarding the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, the role of saturated fatty acids, red meat and the microbiome in CV disease and the current role of personalized CV nutrition. Findings from the PREDIMED study now demonstrate the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet even in the absence of heart disease. The study highlighted that even small, sustained and easily implementable changes to diet can provide significant health benefits even in Mediterranean regions. Likewise, observational data in secondary prevention show that increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with good long-term clinical outcomes among subjects with stable coronary heart disease. The role of saturated fats in the development of CV disease remains controversial, although data suggest that these fats are associated with modestly increased risk of CV events. In contrast, the obesity epidemic currently driving the CV risk worldwide is in large part due to excess consumption of refined carbohydrates. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence suggests that the intestinal microbiome is highly sensitive to lifestyle choices and may play a pivotal role in modulating CV disease development. For example, recent evidence linking processed and unprocessed meats to increased CV risk pointed to the gut microbial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide as a potential culprit.

In addition, all training modalities such as the aerobic (continuous walking, jogging, cycling, etc.) or resistance exercise (weights), as well as the leisure-time physical activity (recreational walking, gardening, etc) prevent the development of the major CV risk factors, or delay the progression of target organ damage improving cardio-metabolic risk. Exercise training is also the core component of all cardiac rehabilitation programs that have demonstrated to improve the quality of life and to reduce morbidity in patients with CV diseases, mostly in patients with coronary artery diseases.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is experiencing a growing burden of cardiometabolic disorders, including diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, coronary heart disease, and stroke. The increasing trends are expected to accelerate as SSA continues to experience economic progress, population growth, and the shift from communicable to noncommunicable diseases. These complex disorders are caused by multiple, potentially interacting, environmental, and genetic factors. While considerable progress has been made in the identification of the sociocultural, demographic, and lifestyle risk factors for cardiometabolic disorders, many genetic factors that underlie individual susceptibility to these diseases remain largely unknown. Although progress in genomic technologies has allowed for systematic characterization of genome-wide genetic diversity in health and disease in European and Asian ancestry populations, conduct of genetic studies in SSA has been underwhelming until recently. Here, we summarize recent understanding of the body of knowledge and highlight research opportunities on the genomics of cardiometabolic disorders in SSA. Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.",pubmed

Because regular physical activity (PA) independently decreases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) while also having a positive, dose-related impact on other cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, it has increasingly become a focus of CHD prevention. Current guidelines recommend 30 min of moderate-intensity PA 5 days a week, but exercise regimens remain underused. PA adherence can be fostered with a multilevel approach that involves active individual participation, physician counselling and health coaching, community involvement, and policy change, with incorporation of cardiac rehabilitation for patients requiring secondary prevention. Viewing exercise quantity as a vital sign, prescribing PA like a medication, and using technology, such as smartphone applications, encourage a global shift in focus from CVD treatment to prevention.

An epidemiological relationship between urolithiasis and cardiovascular diseases has extensively been reported. Endothelial dysfunction is an early pathogenic event in cardiovascular diseases and has been associated with oxidative stress and low chronic inflammation in hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke or the vascular complications of diabetes and obesity. The aim of this study is to summarize the current knowledge about the pathogenic mechanisms of urolithiasis in relation to the development of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular morbidities. A non-systematic review has been performed mixing the terms ""urolithiasis"", ""kidney stone"" or ""nephrolithiasis"" with ""cardiovascular disease"", ""myocardial infarction"", ""stroke"", or ""endothelial dysfunction"". Patients with nephrolithiasis develop a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease with a relative risk estimated between 1.20 and 1.24 and also develop a higher vascular disease risk scores. Analyses of subgroups have rendered inconclusive results regarding gender or age. Endothelial dysfunction has also been strongly associated with urolithiasis in clinical studies, although no systemic serum markers of endothelial dysfunction, inflammation or oxidative stress could be clearly related. Analysis of urine composition of lithiasic patients also detected a higher expression of proteins related to cardiovascular disease. Experimental models of hyperoxaluria have also found elevation of serum endothelial dysfunction markers. Endothelial dysfunction has been strongly associated with urolithiasis and based on the experimental evidence, should be considered as an intermediate and changeable feature between urolithiasis and cardiovascular diseases. Oxidative stress, a key pathogenic factor in the development of endothelial dysfunction has been also pointed out as an important factor of lithogenesis.

Cardiovascular ageing and the atherosclerotic process begin very early in life, most likely in utero. They progress over decades of exposure to suboptimal or abnormal metabolic and hormonal risk factors, eventually culminating in very common, costly, and mostly preventable target-organ pathologies, including coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, aortic aneurysm, peripheral artery disease, and vascular dementia. In this Review, we discuss findings from preclinical and clinical studies showing that calorie restriction (CR), intermittent fasting, and adjusted diurnal rhythm of feeding, with adequate intake of specific macronutrients and micronutrients, are powerful interventions not only for the prevention of cardiovascular disease but also for slowing the accumulation of molecular damage leading to cardiometabolic dysfunction.

A nationwide cohort of Spanish adults (18-64 years) was studied using a cross-sectional design and prospective observational design. Lifestyle-related factors (physical activity, sleeping characteristics, alcohol drinking, and smoking) were registered, and participants were classified as having an 'unhealthy' or 'healthy' cardiometabolic status attending to the presence or absence, respectively, of ≥1 CVD risk factor. A number of 596 111 participants (44 ± 9 years, 67% male) were studied at baseline, with prospective analyses in a subcohort [n = 302 061; median follow-up, 2 years (range, 2 to 5)].

cardiovascular_38939566,38939566,cardiovascular,2024.0,"Exercise blood pressure, cardiorespiratory fitness, fatness and cardiovascular risk in children and adolescents.. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality on a global scale. Individuals who possess risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure (BP) and obesity, face an elevated risk of experiencing organ-specific pathophysiological changes. This damage includes pathophysiological changes in the heart and peripheral vascular systems, such as ventricular hypertrophy, arterial stiffening, and vascular narrowing and stenosis. Consequently, these damages are associated with an increased risk of developing severe cardiovascular outcomes including stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and coronary heart disease. Among all the risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure emerges as the most prominent. However, conventional resting BP measurement methods such as auscultatory or oscillometric methods may fail to identify many individuals with asymptomatic high BP. Recently, exercise BP has emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying real (high) blood pressure levels and assessing underlying cardiovascular risk, in addition to resting BP measurements in adults. Furthermore, numerous established factors, such as low cardiorespiratory fitness and high body fatness, have been confirmed to contribute to exercise BP and the associated cardiovascular risk. Modifying these factors may help reduce high exercise BP and, consequently, alleviate the burden of cardiovascular disease. A significant body of evidence has demonstrated cardiovascular disease in later life have their origins in early life. Children and adolescents with these cardiovascular risk factors also possess a greater propensity to develop cardiovascular diseases later in life. Nevertheless, the majority of previous studies on the clinical utility of exercise BP have been conducted in middle-to-older aged populations, often with pre-existing clinical conditions. Therefore, there is a need to investigate further of the factors influencing exercise BP in adolescence and its association with cardiovascular risk in early life. Our previously published work showed that exercise BP is a potential useful method to detect adolescents with increased cardiovascular risk. Children and adolescents with cardiovascular risk factors are more likely to develop cardiovascular diseases later in life. However, previous studies on the clinical utility of exercise BP have largely focused on middle-to-older aged populations with pre-existing clinical conditions. Therefore, there is a need to investigate further the factors influencing exercise BP in adolescence and its association with future cardiovascular risk. Our previous studies, which focused on exercise BP measured at submaximal intensity, have shown that exercise BP is a potentially useful method for identifying adolescents at increased cardiovascular risk. Our previous findings suggest that improving cardio-respiratory fitness and reducing body fatness may help to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and improve overall cardiovascular health. These findings have important implications for the development of effective prevention and early detection strategies, which can contribute to improved public health outcomes.",pubmed

Hypertension and hyperlipidaemia are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lifestyle interventions, including modifications in diet, nutrition, and physical activity, are commonly recommended, but their causal effects on these conditions remain uncertain. This study aims to explore the causal effects of these factors on hypertension and hyperlipidaemia using multivariate Mendelian randomisation analysis, providing insights for effective cardiovascular prevention strategies. Genetic data related to physical activity, diet, and nutrition were obtained from public databases and analyzed using multivariate Mendelian randomisation. The analysis employed MR Egger, weighted median, and inverse variance weighting (IVW) methods, with tests for heterogeneity and multiplicity ensuring the reliability of the results. In the hypertension analysis, low-calorie diets showed a positive association in weighted median and IVW analyses, with weighted median analysis showing an association of 1.122 (95% CI: 1.014-1.243, P = 0.026) and IVW analysis showing an association of 1.095 (95% CI: 1.013-1.184, P = 0.023).

Calcium supplements and dietary fibre did not demonstrate significant associations across all methods. Physical activity also did not show significant causal links with hypertension. Regarding hyperlipidaemia, calcium supplements exhibited significant effects across all methods, though with notable variation, while dietary fibre and physical activity showed no significant impacts. The study suggests a positive association between low-calorie diets and hypertension, as indicated by significant results from weighted median and IVW analyses. Other dietary factors, physical activity, and calcium supplementation exhibited varied or non-significant effects on hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. These findings highlight the need for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms and support the development of effective public health interventions.",pubmed

Diet, exercise, stress, and sleep are receiving attention as environmental modifiers of chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, the culprit condition of myocardial infarction and stroke. Accumulating data indicate that psychosocial stress and a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet aggravate cardiovascular disease, whereas regular physical activity and healthy sleeping habits help prevent it. Here, we raise the possibility that inflammation-associated leukocyte production plays a causal role in lifestyle effects on atherosclerosis progression. Specifically, we explore whether and how potent real-life disease modifiers influence hematopoiesis' molecular and cellular machinery. Lifestyle, we hypothesize, may rearrange hematopoietic topography, diverting production from the bone marrow to the periphery, thus propagating a quantitative and qualitative drift of the macrophage supply chain. These changes may involve progenitor-extrinsic and intrinsic communication nodes that connect organ systems along neuroimmune and immunometabolic axes, ultimately leading to an altered number and phenotype of lesional macrophages. We propose that, in conjunction with improved public health policy, future therapeutics could aim to modulate the quantitative and qualitative output, as well as the location, of the hematopoietic tree to decrease the risk of atherosclerosis complications.",pubmed

Obesity is a risk factor for various subtypes of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF), and stroke. Nevertheless, there are limited comparisons of the associations of obesity with each of these CVD subtypes, particularly regarding the extent to which they are unexplained by traditional CVD mediators. We followed 13 730 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study who had a body mass index ≥18.5 and no CVD at baseline (visit 1, 1987-1989). We compared the association of higher body mass index with incident HF, CHD, and stroke before and after adjusting for traditional CVD mediators (including systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and lipid measures). Over a median follow-up of 23 years, there were 2235 HF events, 1653 CHD events, and 986 strokes. After adjustment for demographics, smoking, physical activity, and alcohol intake, higher body mass index had the strongest association with incident HF among CVD subtypes, with hazard ratios for severe obesity (body mass index ≥35 versus normal weight) of 3.74 (95% CI 3.24-4.31) for HF, 2.00 (95% CI 1.67-2.40) for CHD, and 1.75 (95% CI 1.40-2.20) for stroke (P<0.0001 for comparisons of HF versus CHD or stroke). Further adjustment for traditional mediators fully explained the association of higher body mass index with CHD and stroke but not with HF (hazard ratio 2.27, 95% CI 1.94-2.64).

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in industrialized nations. Due to the high number of patients and expensive treatments, according to the Federal Statistical Office (2017) in Germany, cardiovascular diseases account for around 15% of total health costs. Advanced coronary artery disease is mainly the result of chronic disorders such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. In the modern obesogenic environment, many people are at greater risk of being overweight or obese. The hemodynamic load on the heart is influenced by extreme obesity, which often leads to myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure. In addition, obesity leads to a chronic inflammatory state and negatively affects the wound-healing process. It has been known for many years that lifestyle interventions such as exercise, healthy nutrition, and smoking cessation drastically reduce cardiovascular risk and have a preventive effect against disorders in the healing process.

We searched 5 databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and OpenGrey) through 31 October 2020. Four investigators independently screened the full texts for inclusion, assessed quality, and extracted data from published reports. Out of the 5729 identified records, 7 were included, comprising over 73,000 participants, of whom at least 7661 were vegans. Three studies, with at least 73,426 individuals (including at least 7380 vegans), examined risks of primary cardiovascular events (total CVD, coronary heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, total stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and ischemic stroke) in individuals who followed a vegan diet compared to those who did not. None of the studies reported a significantly increased or decreased risk of any cardiovascular outcome. One study suggested that vegans were at greater risk of ischemic stroke compared to individuals who consumed animal products (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.95-2.48).

To evaluate whether cardiovascular risk, risk awareness, and guideline concordant treatment differ in individuals with versus without epilepsy. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We included participants ≥18 years for 2013-2018. We classified participants as having epilepsy if reporting ≥1 medication treating seizures. We calculated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk using the revised pooled cohort equation. We compared unadjusted and adjusted risk for participants with versus without epilepsy. We then assessed hypertension and diabetes disease awareness and control, plus statin guideline-concordance. We assessed mediators for both ASCVD risk and cardiovascular disease awareness. Of 17,961 participants, 154 (0.9%) had epilepsy. Participants with epilepsy reported poorer diet (p = 0.03), fewer minutes of moderate-vigorous activity per day (p < 0.01), and increased frequency of cardiovascular conditions (e.g. coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke). There was no difference in control of individual examination and laboratory risk factors between groups (A1c, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol). However, epilepsy was associated with 52% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0-130%) increase in ASCVD risk, which became nonsignificant after adjusting for health behaviors.

In this review, we describe the acute and chronic epigenetic effects of physical activity and dietary changes. We propose exercise and nutrition as potential triggers of epigenetic signals, promoting the reshaping of transcriptional programmes with effects on CVD phenotypes. Finally, we highlight recent developments in epigenetic therapeutics with implications for primary and secondary CVD prevention.",pubmed

People with axial spondyloarthritis (AS) have an inflammatory profile, increasing the risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidaemia. Consequently, AS is linked with co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). Physical inactivity, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity influence inflammation, but knowledge of the interaction between these with inflammation, disease activity, and CVD risk in AS is dominated by cross-sectional research. A review of the literature was conducted between July 2020 and December 2021. The focus of the scoping review is to summarise longitudinal and randomised control trials in humans to investigate how tracking or modifying lifestyle influences inflammation and disease burden in patients with AS. (1) Lifestyle modifications, especially increased physical activity (PA), exercise, and smoking cessation, are critical in managing AS. (2) Smoking is negatively associated with patient reported outcome measures with AS, plus pharmaceutical treatment adherence, but links with structural radiographic progression are inconclusive. (3) Paucity of data warrant structured studies measuring inflammatory cytokine responses to lifestyle modification in AS. Increased PA, exercise, and smoking cessation should be supported at every given opportunity to improve health outcomes in patients with AS. The link between smoking and radiographic progression needs further investigation. Studies investigating the longitudinal effect of body weight, alcohol, and psychosocial factors on disease activity and physical function in patients with AS are needed. Given the link between inflammation and AS, future studies should also incorporate markers of chronic inflammation beyond the standard C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurements.",pubmed

Prolonged sedentary life existence is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD), obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, heart failure (HF), and all-cause mortality. On the contrary, regular exercise is known from antiquity to be associated with beneficial cardiovascular (CV) effects and decreased mortality. The cardiovascular (CV) benefits of exercise have been confirmed by many studies, but the trajectories of the different modes of PA are not well recognized. In order to examine the different modalities of exercise and its long-term trajectories, a Medline search of the English literature was conducted between 2015 and 2022 and 60 pertinent papers were selected for review. Careful review of the selected papers showed that the beneficial CV effects of PA are mediated through several favorable modifications of molecular and clinical factors. Also, any type of physical activity in conjunction with lifestyle adjustments is associated with decreased incidence of CVD, CHD, obesity, T2DM, hypertension, HF, and all-cause mortality. In addition, the long-term trajectories regarding the duration and the level of exercise are associated with greater beneficial CV effects, with even the resumption of discontinued exercise can lead to beneficial CV effects.",pubmed

Hypertension, the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, originates from combined genetic, environmental, and social determinants. Environmental factors include overweight/obesity, unhealthy diet, excessive dietary sodium, inadequate dietary potassium, insufficient physical activity, and consumption of alcohol. Prevention and control of hypertension can be achieved through targeted and/or population-based strategies. For control of hypertension, the targeted strategy involves interventions to increase awareness, treatment, and control in individuals. Corresponding population-based strategies involve interventions designed to achieve a small reduction in blood pressure (BP) in the entire population. Having a usual source of care, optimizing adherence, and minimizing therapeutic inertia are associated with higher rates of BP control. The Chronic Care Model, a collaborative partnership among the patient, provider, and health system, incorporates a multilevel approach for control of hypertension. Optimizing the prevention, recognition, and care of hypertension requires a paradigm shift to team-based care and the use of strategies known to control BP.",pubmed

Hypertension is a worldwide prevalent disease, mostly manifested as its primary ethiology, characterized by a chronic, multifactorial, asymptomatic, and usually incurable state. It is estimated that more than one billion of the world population is hypertensive. Also, hypertension is the main cause of the two most frequent causes of death worldwide: myocardial infarction and stroke. Due to the necessity of the cardiovascular system to manage chronically increased levels of blood pressure, hypertension causes severe alterations in multiple organs, as the heart, vessels, kidneys, eyes and brain, thus increasing the risk of health complications. The heart is the main target organ and suffers several adaptations to compensate the increased blood pressure levels; nevertheless, long-term adaptations without proper control are extremely harmful to cardiovascular health. On the other hand, hypertension is a modifiable risk factor and its adequate control is highly dependent on lifestyle. Pharmacological treatment is of great success when adherence is high. Several classes of antihypertensive drugs are prescribed and can effectively maintain blood pressure within acceptable levels. However, non-pharmacological methods, as diet and exercise training, can not only optimize the treatment but also prevent or postpone hypertension development as well as its complications, acting as important complements to the ideal control of elevated blood pressure, and bringing together benefits beyond blood pressure decrease, as a general health status improvement and increased quality of life. There is consistent evidence that regular exercise training promotes several benefits when properly prescribed and practised, acting as ""medicine"" for dozens of chronic diseases. The effects of exercise training in blood pressure levels and in its mechanisms of control are of clinical relevance and efficacy. This chapter will describe the classical and recent results on the beneficial effects of different modalities of exercise training in the cardiovascular system of human primary hypertension, focusing on the mechanisms influenced by exercise training which help to decrease blood pressure and improve the cardiovascular system.",pubmed

As obesity is a traditional risk factor for stroke, obesity should be managed in stroke survivors to prevent stroke recurrence. A cross-sectional secondary data analysis analyzed data from the 2017 United States Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. Demographics, frequency of vegetable and fruit intake, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and sleep were examined. Among 1032 stroke survivors, 57.8% were obese. Advanced age, female sex, veteran status, at least once-daily fruit intake, current smoking, and lack of physical activity were associated with obesity.

Metabolic disorders are increasing worldwide and are characterized by various risk factors such as abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose metabolism, and dyslipidemia. Observational studies suggested a bidirectional association between cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders and its components. However, the causal associations between them remained unclear. This study aims to investigate the causal relationship between metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. A two-sample MR analysis based on publicly available genome-wide association studies were used to infer the causality. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms with potential pleiotropy were excluded by MR-PRESSO. The effect estimates were constructed using the random-effects inverse-variance-weighted method as the primary estimate. Furthermore, MR-Egger and weighted median were also performed to detect heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Genetically predicted metabolic disorders increased the risk for coronary heart disease (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.55-2.03, p < 0.001), myocardial infarction (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.52-2.03, p < 0.001), heart failure (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.14-1.39, p < 0.001), hypertension (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02, p = 0.002), and stroke (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08-1.32, p < 0.001). The concordance of the results of various complementary sensitivity MR methods reinforces the causal relationship further.

Physical inactivity (PI) is associated with the development of non-communicable chronic diseases. The purposes of this study were to estimate the extent to which the 31% relative increase in PI among 35-64 years old Mexicans between 2006 and 2012 influenced diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality, and to estimate the impact of the World Health Organization recommended 10% and 15% relative decrease in PI on CVD and T2D incidence and mortality by 2025 and 2030, respectively. Estimates were derived using the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model-Mexico, a computer simulation, Markov model. Model inputs included cross-national data on PI levels from 2006 and 2012 measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the published literature review on the independent relationship between PI and cardiometabolic risk. The models estimated that the 31% increase in PI resulted in an increase in the number of cases of T2D (27,100), coronary heart disease (10,300), stroke (2200), myocardial infarction (1500), stroke deaths (400) and coronary heart disease deaths (350). A hypothetical 10% lowering of PI by 2025 compared to status quo is projected to prevent 8400 cases of T2D, 4200 cases of CHD, 1000 cases of stroke, 700 cases of MI, and 200 deaths of CHD and stroke, respectively.

In this cohort, we aimed to investigate the associations between both total and leisure time physical activity in detail, and the risks of myocardial infarction and stroke, both overall and for men and women separately. We assessed the association between total and leisure time physical activity on the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in a cohort of 31,580 men and women through record linkages from 1997-2016. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on detailed self-reported physical activity. In the adjusted analyses, we included age, sex, body mass index, level of education, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, lipid disturbance and hypertension as potential confounders. We identified 1,621 incident cases of myocardial infarction and 1,879 of stroke. Among men, there was an inverse association between leisure time activity and myocardial infarction in the third tertile compared to the first (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.62-0.98; p for trend = 0.03). We also found an inverse association between leisure time activity and stroke in the third tertile compared to the first (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61-0.99; p for trend = 0.04), while the corresponding HR for stroke among women was 0.91; 95% CI: 0.74-1.13.

Despite these recommendations, pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists continue to struggle with how best to counsel their patients regarding appropriate forms of physical activity, the impact of exercise on blood pressure, and how best to screen for cardiovascular conditions that place youth at risk for sudden cardiac death. This review provides a summary of our current knowledge regarding the safety and utility of exercise in the management of high blood pressure in youth. We review determinants of blood pressure during exercise, the impact of blood pressure on cardiovascular health and structure, mechanisms for assessing cardiometabolic fitness (e.g., exercise stress test), contraindications to athletic participation, and how best to plan for athletic participation among hypertensive youth. Greater knowledge in these areas may offer clarity to providers faced with the challenge of prescribing exercise recommendations for hypertensive youth.",pubmed

Psoriasis is a common and chronic inflammatory disease of the skin. It may impair the physical and psychosocial function of patients and lead to decreased quality of life. Traditionally, psoriasis has been regarded as a disease affecting only the skin and joints. More recently, studies have shown that psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disorder which can be associated with various comorbidities. In particular, psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of developing severe vascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. In addition, the prevalence rates of cardiovascular risk factors are increased, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Consequently, mortality rates have been found to be increased and life expectancy decreased in patients with psoriasis, as compared to the general population. Various studies have also shown that systemic treatments for psoriasis, including methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, may significantly decrease cardiovascular risk. Mechanistically, the presence of common inflammatory pathways, secretion of adipokines, insulin resistance, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, microparticles, and hypercoagulability may explain the association between psoriasis and cardiometabolic disorders.

Although cardiovascular comorbidities negatively impact survival in patients with bronchiectasis, there is limited evidence to recommend exercise in this population. We aimed to evaluate whether exercise habit changes are related to reduced cardiovascular disease risk and explore an optimal exercise amount. This study identified 165,842 patients with newly diagnosed bronchiectasis during 2010-2016 who underwent two health examinations and were followed up until December 2020. The exposure was the change in weekly habits of moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity between the two examinations, classified into non-exercisers and exercisers (further classified into new exercisers, exercise dropouts, and exercise maintainers). The amount of exercise was measured using metabolic equivalents of task (MET). The outcome was the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. During a mean of 6.2 ± 2.1 follow-up years, 4,233 (2.6%) and 3,745 (2.3%) of patients with bronchiectasis had MI or stroke, respectively. Compared to non-exercisers, exercisers had a significantly lower risk of MI or stroke by 9-28% (p < 0.001 for both). Among exercisers, exercise maintainers showed the lowest risk of MI (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.81) and stroke (aHR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64-0.82) compared to non-exercisers. Regarding exercise amount, a significant risk reduction was observed only in patients with bronchiectasis who exercised for ≥ 500 MET-min/wk. Exercise was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients with bronchiectasis. In particular, the risk was lowest in exercise maintainers, and cardiovascular risk reduction was significant when exercising more than 500 MET-min/wk.",pubmed

The rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality reduction in the United States has plateaued recently, despite the development of novel preventive pharmacotherapies, increased access to care, and healthcare spending. This is largely due to American's poor dietary patterns and practices causing increasing trends in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. For decades, dietary guidelines on 'healthy diets' to reduce CVD risk, grounded in epidemiological research, have been nationally distributed to Americans. In this review, we highlight landmark events in modern nutrition science and how these have framed past and current understandings of diet and health. We also follow the evolution of dietary recommendations for Americans throughout the years, with an emphasis on recommendations aimed to reduce risk for CVD and mortality. Secondly, we examine how the low-fat ideology came to dominate America in the last decades of the 20th century and subsequently contributed to an excess intake of refined carbohydrates which, in the context of an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, may have fueled the obesity epidemic. We then examine the current major evidence-based dietary patterns and specific dietary approaches to reduce CVD risk, reviewing the literature surrounding nutritional components of the heart-healthy diet and discussing the dietary patterns proven most effective for CVD prevention: the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, the Mediterranean diet, and the healthy vegetarian diet.

The prevalence of overweight and obesity in young people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) now parallels that of the general population. Excess adiposity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is already elevated up to 10-fold in T1D, underscoring a compelling need to address weight management as part of routine T1D care. Sustainable weight management requires both diet and physical activity (PA). Diet and PA approaches must be optimized towards the underlying metabolic and behavioral challenges unique to T1D to support glycemic control throughout the day. Diet strategies for people with T1D need to take into consideration glycemic management, metabolic status, clinical goals, personal preferences, and sociocultural considerations. A major barrier to weight management in this high-risk population is the challenge of integrating regular PA with day-to-day management of T1D. Specifically, exercise poses a substantial challenge due to the increased risk of hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemia. Indeed, about two-thirds of individuals with T1D do not engage in the recommended amount of PA. Hypoglycemia presents a serious health risk, yet prevention and treatment often necessitates the consumption of additional calories, which may prohibit weight loss over time. Exercising safely is a concern and challenge with weight management and maintaining cardiometabolic health for individuals living with T1D and many healthcare professionals. Thus, a tremendous opportunity exists to improve exercise participation and cardiometabolic outcomes in this population.

The authors also clarified the potential clinical value of TMAO as a predictor of cardiovascular disease．. The intestinal microbiota metabolite TMAO is closely related to the occurrence and development of coronary heart disease. TMAO can induce the development of coronary heart disease by promoting endothelial cell dysfunction, promoting foam cell formation, affecting cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, and promoting platelet activation and thrombosis. Diet, physical exercise, and other ways can reshape intestinal flora, inhibit TMAO generation, and help to prevent and cure coronary heart disease. In addition, TMAO has important clinical value in predicting risk stratification and evaluating the prognosis of coronary heart disease. TMAO can induce and assist in the development of coronary heart disease by promoting endothelial cell dysfunction, foam cell formation, and other mechanisms. At present, diet and physical exercise can reduce the production of TMAO to a certain extent, to prevent the occurrence and development of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, TMAO is a promising predictive marker for risk stratification and evaluating the prognosis of coronary heart disease.TMAO can not only directly induce coronary heart disease by promoting endothelial cell dysfunction, foam cell formation and other mechanisms, but also promote the occurrence and development of coronary heart disease by affecting the risk factors related to coronary heart disease (such as hypertension and diabetes).

There are several forms of heart pathology, e.g., the most common coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, heart valve disease and abnormal heart rhythms. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world and varies by race, where indigenous and people of color have a higher risk for its complications than the white population. The morbidity of cardiovascular pathology in the Afro-American community persists high and is a primary source of disparities in life expectancy between Afro-Americans and whites in the United States.

However, it is unclear whether this inverse association exists across all subgroups at high risk for HF, particularly among those with preexisting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Methods and Results We followed 13 810 ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study participants (mean age 55 years, 54% women, 26% black) without HF at baseline (visit 1; 1987-1989).

We constructed Cox models to estimate associations between PA categories and incident HF within each high-risk subgroup at baseline, with tests for interaction. We performed additional analyses modeling incident coronary heart disease as a time-varying covariate. Over a median of 26 years of follow-up, there were 2994 HF events. Compared with poor PA, recommended PA was associated with lower HF risk among participants with hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome (all <i>P</i><0.01), but not among those with prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease) (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74-1.13 [<i>P</i> interaction=0.02]).

The adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) was high in 29.7% and low in 14.7%. Most of the sample showed a good physical activity level. The AIP risk increased with higher obesity indicators and LDL cholesterol levels. There was an inverse relationship between the MedDiet adherence and vigorous physical activity and the risk of atherogenicity. Elevated rates of overweight, abdominal obesity and hypercholesterolemia were found, contributing to the atherogenic risk of plasma (AIP). This parameter was significantly associated with all anthropometric indicators and LDL cholesterol.

Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) refers to the ability of the cardiopulmonary system to supply oxygen to skeletal muscles during exercise. Regular physical activity optimizes these systems by physiologic means that not only decrease cardiovascular risk factors but also independently affect mortality. Importantly, CRF is an integrative measure of the effects of its upstream risk factors including physical activity and genetics. In this review, we summarize the main methods that are frequently used to estimate CRF. We cite findings from the major studies on CRF, which demonstrate a beneficial effect on prevalent cardiovascular risk factor burden, subclinical atherosclerosis, and incident adverse outcomes including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancer. We conclude by suggesting the incorporation of CRF into clinical decision-making given the prognostic information it provides.",pubmed

Self-management of hypertension is particularly emphasized for older patients. Specifically, it is critical that initiatives regarding lifestyle modifications be applied to reduce the cardiovascular burden of hypertension among the elderly population. We included participants aged 65 years or older with hypertension from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) years 1999-2018 to analyze the adherence to lifestyle recommendations and the control of cardiovascular risk factors. Recommended lifestyle behaviors and targets for cardiovascular risk factor controls were defined according to the clinical guidelines for the management of hypertension. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to identify factors associated with nonadherence. Of 10,162 participants (mean age, 74.45 years) included, 4350 (42.81%) had controlled blood pressure. Adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors varied among respondents. Smoking cessation (88.82%) and alcohol reduction (74.11%) were relatively high, whereas adherence to physical activity (14.57%), low salt diet (36.81%), and fiber intake (12.87%) were significantly lower. A significant proportion of respondents achieved target levels for LDL-C (76.00%) and HbA1c (72.49%), whereas fewer participants met BMI (25.02%) and waist circumference (31.26%) goals for cardiovascular risk factor control.

Life expectancy is steadily increasing in modern societies, and so are noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and cancer, accounting for more than 70% of all deaths globally. The costs associated with these diseases are enormous, but it has been estimated that the majority of these noncommunicable diseases are preventable. In addition to an unhealthy diet, tobacco use, and harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity is a key risk factor. Consequently, physical activity is a logical remedy, and in this chapter an overview of the numerous beneficial effects of physical activity on health and performance is given.The chapter is divided into three parts: First, the basics of physical activity and exercise are discussed, for instance exercise classification, exercise intensity operationalization, energy supply, and the acute effects of exercise such as blood flow redistribution and increased cardiac output. In the second part, the effects of exercise on physical performance are summarized. Specifically, it is discussed how endurance, strength, power, and balance can be improved. This discussion includes recommendations regarding the type, intensity, and duration of the exercise leading to improvements in one of these aspects of physical performance, as well as the mechanisms causing these adaptations. In the third part, the beneficial effects of physical activity on physical and mental health are outlined, with particular attention to cardiovascular diseases, the metabolic syndrome, musculoskeletal diseases, mood, anxiety, depression, and dementia.It can be concluded that with adequate programming, regular physical activity is an effective way to improve physical performance, improve physical and mental health, and reduce the risk factors for many noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and depression. In contrast to medication, physical exercise has no negative side effects, costs very little, and targets many health issues at once. If the multitude of beneficial effects of regular exercise were to be combined in a single low-cost drug, it would be prescribed for almost all types of physical and mental health issues.",pubmed

To examine the association of Life's Essential 8 (LE8) with the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events among patients with CHD. This prospective cohort study included 11,997 patients with CHD from the UK Biobank. The LE8 score was generated using five lifestyle factors (diet, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, and sleep) and three biological factors (blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure). LE8 score ranged from 0 to 100 and was categorized into quartiles. Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI (confidence interval). During a median follow up of 12.5 years, we documented 3366 recurrent cardiovascular events, 1068 myocardial infarction, 1829 heart failure events, 703 strokes, and 934 cardiovascular deaths. The multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CI) for the highest versus the lowest quartile of LE8 score was 0.57 (0.50, 0.65) for recurrent cardiovascular events, 0.66 (0.52, 0.83) for myocardial infarction, 0.54 (0.45, 0.67) for heart failure, 0.50 (0.36, 0.68) for stroke, and 0.46 (0.37, 0.56) for cardiovascular death. Furthermore, the population attributable fraction of the lowest to the highest quartile of LE8 score were ranged from 16.2% to 32.5% for the various cardiovascular outcomes. In addition, biomarkers including renal function and inflammation collectively explained 47.6%-87.7% of the associations between the lifestyle factors and recurrent cardiovascular events. Better cardiovascular health as measured by LE8 was associated with significantly lower risk of recurrent cardiovascular events among patients with CHD.

Inflammation is a contributory factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diet can modulate inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the association between dietary inflammatory index (DII) and CVD outcomes, and the mediating roles of cardiovascular risk factors. A prospective cohort study. A total of 3,013 Chinese community-dwelling older adults aged ≥65 years without CVD were included between 2001 and 2003 in Hong Kong. DII was calculated using a 280-item validated food frequency questionnaire. CVD outcomes included incident CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and CVD mortality, which were obtained from official records. Cox proportional hazards models examined the association between tertiles of DII and CVD outcomes. Mediation analysis explored the mediating roles of cardiovascular risk factors, including inflammatory biomarkers, impaired renal function, abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI), obesity, central obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. There were 263 CVD cases, 147 CHD cases, and 130 strokes during a median follow-up of 5.7 years. There were 277 CVD deaths during a median follow-up of 16.8 years. The highest tertile of DII was associated with increased risks of CVD incidence (HR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.05-1.96) and CVD mortality (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.03-2.03) compared with the lowest tertile. No significant associations were found for CHD and stroke. Impaired renal function, abnormal ABI, and hyperhomocysteinemia mediated the effects of a pro-inflammatory diet on CVD risk, with mediated proportions ranging from 3.68% to 7.78%.

Several studies provide evidence for an association between MAFLD and atherosclerosis and cardio-metabolic disorders, including CVDs such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Therefore, the combination of MAFLD/NASH is associated with vascular risk and CVD progression, but the underlying mechanisms linking MAFLD/NASH and CVD are still under investigation. Several underlying mechanisms may probably be involved, including hepatic/systemic insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, as well as pro-atherogenic, pro-coagulant, and pro-inflammatory mediators released from the steatotic/inflamed liver. MAFLD is strongly associated with insulin resistance, which is involved in its pathogenesis and progression to NASH. Insulin resistance is a major cardiovascular risk factor in subjects without diabetes. However, T2D has been considered the most common link between MAFLD/NASH and CVD. This review summarizes the evidence linking obesity with MAFLD, NASH, and CVD, considering the pathophysiological molecular mechanisms involved in these diseases.

Background There have been limited data examining the age-dependent relationship of wide-range risk factors with the incidence of each subtype of cardiovascular disease (CVD) event. We assessed age-related associations between modifiable risk factors and the incidence of CVD. Methods and Results We analyzed 3 027 839 participants without a CVD history enrolled in the JMDC Claims Database (mean age, 44.8±11.0 years; 57.6% men). Each participant was categorized as aged 20 to 49 years (n=2 008 559), 50 to 59 years (n=712 273), and 60 to 75 years (n=307 007). Using Cox proportional hazards models and the relative risk reduction, we identified associations between risk factors and incident CVD, consisting of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, and heart failure (HF). We assessed whether the association of risk factors for developing CVD would be modified by age category. Over a mean follow-up of 1133 days, 6315 myocardial infarction, 56 447 angina pectoris, 28 079 stroke, and 56 369 HF events were recorded. The incidence of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, and HF increased with age category. Hazard ratios of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes in the multivariable Cox regression analyses for myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, and HF decreased with age category. The relative risk reduction of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes for CVD events decreased with age category. For example, the relative risk reduction of hypertension for HF decreased from 59.2% in participants aged 20 to 49 years to 38.1% in those aged 60 to 75 years. Conclusions The contribution of modifiable risk factor to the development of CVD is greater in younger compared with older individuals. Preventive efforts for risk factor modification may be more effective in younger people.",pubmed

Participants included 4521 adults from the 2013 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey physical activity monitoring examination. Wrist-worn ActiGraph GT3X+ data were used to estimate RARs. Multivariable logistic models evaluated associations of RARs with prevalent CVD, hypertension, obesity, and central adiposity. Participants (mean age, 49 years) in the highest versus lowest tertile of relative amplitude (greater circadian rhythmicity) had 39% to 62% lower odds of prevalent CVD, hypertension, obesity, and central adiposity. A more active wake period was associated with 19% to 72% lower CVD, hypertension, obesity, and central adiposity odds. Higher interdaily stability (regular sleep-wake and rest-activity patterns) was related to 52% and 23% lower CVD and obesity odds, respectively. In contrast, participants in the highest versus lowest tertile of intradaily variability (fragmented RAR and inefficient sleep) had >3-fold and 24% higher CVD and obesity odds, respectively. A later and less restful sleep period was associated with 36% to 2-fold higher CVD, hypertension, obesity, and central adiposity odds. A statistically significant linear trend was observed for all associations (<i>P</i>-trend<0.05).

It is established that physical activity on a regular basis has a positive influence on the majority of vascular risk factors (e. g. on obesity, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation and so on). After a stroke, one of the main challenges is reducing the risk of a recurrent event and its possible consequences. Other important challenges are improving impaired brain functions, quality of life and independence in the activity of daily living as well as reintegration into the community [1]. Stroke-induced impairment of brain function has, besides its effects on motor, sensory, visual and speech functions, an influence on cognition and mood, which are determinants of physical activity after stroke [2]. Type, intensity and amount of physical activity have to be adjusted according to comorbidities and, if present, to residual neurologic impairments after a stroke.",pubmed

They also control diverse biological functions like development, differentiation, growth, and metabolism. Among ncRNAs, the short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been extensively studied, but their specific functions remain largely unknown. In recent years, miRNAs are efficiently studied as one of the important candidates for involvement in most biological processes and have been implicated in many human diseases.

Since loss of β-cell function is the ultimate cause of developing overt type 2 diabetes, environmental and lifestyle changes must have resulted in a higher risk of β-cell damage in those at genetic risk. Multiple mechanistic pathways may come into play. Strategies of diabetes prevention should aim at promoting a 'diabetes-protective lifestyle' whilst simultaneously enhancing the resistance of the human organism to pro-diabetic environmental and lifestyle factors. More research on diabetes-protective mechanisms seems warranted.",pubmed

Nonmodifiable risk factors include age, genetics, epigenetics, and social determinants of health (including education level, socioeconomic status, and noise and arsenic exposure). Modifiable risk factors include obesity, the microbiome, diet, cigarette smoking, sleep duration, sleep quality, and sedentary behavior. Major lifestyle interventions to prevent and treat diabetes relate to these risk factors. Weight loss is the lifestyle intervention with the largest benefit for both preventing and treating diabetes.

Together with other lifestyle factors like exercise and behavior modification, diet plays a central role in achieving weight loss. Diets vary based on the type and amount of carbohydrate, fat, and protein consumed to meet daily caloric intake goals. A number of popular diets are reviewed as well as studies evaluating the effect of various diets on weight loss, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors. Current trends favor the low-carbohydrate, low-glycemic index, Mediterranean, and very-low-calorie diets. However, no optimal dietary strategy exists for patients with obesity and diabetes, and more research is needed.

Type 2 diabetes is one of the major chronic diseases accounting for a substantial proportion of disease burden in Western countries. The majority of the burden of type 2 diabetes is attributed to environmental risks and modifiable risk factors such as lifestyle. The environment we live in, and changes to it, can thus contribute substantially to the prevention of type 2 diabetes at a population level. The 'exposome' represents the (measurable) totality of environmental, i.e. nongenetic, drivers of health and disease. The external exposome comprises aspects of the built environment, the social environment, the physico-chemical environment and the lifestyle/food environment. The internal exposome comprises measurements at the epigenetic, transcript, proteome, microbiome or metabolome level to study either the exposures directly, the imprints these exposures leave in the biological system, the potential of the body to combat environmental insults and/or the biology itself. In this review, we describe the evidence for environmental risk factors of type 2 diabetes, focusing on both the general external exposome and imprints of this on the internal exposome. Studies provided established associations of air pollution, residential noise and area-level socioeconomic deprivation with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, while neighbourhood walkability and green space are consistently associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. There is little or inconsistent evidence on the contribution of the food environment, other aspects of the social environment and outdoor temperature. These environmental factors are thought to affect type 2 diabetes risk mainly through mechanisms incorporating lifestyle factors such as physical activity or diet, the microbiome, inflammation or chronic stress. To further assess causality of these associations, future studies should focus on investigating the longitudinal effects of our environment (and changes to it) in relation to type 2 diabetes risk and whether these associations are explained by these proposed mechanisms.",pubmed
diabetes_29433995,29433995,diabetes,2018.0,"Precision nutrition for prevention and management of type 2 diabetes.. Precision nutrition aims to prevent and manage chronic diseases by tailoring dietary interventions or recommendations to one or a combination of an individual's genetic background, metabolic profile, and environmental exposures. Recent advances in genomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome technologies have offered opportunities as well as challenges in the use of precision nutrition to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes. Nutrigenomics studies have identified genetic variants that influence intake and metabolism of specific nutrients and predict individuals' variability in response to dietary interventions. Metabolomics has revealed metabolomic fingerprints of food and nutrient consumption and uncovered new metabolic pathways that are potentially modified by diet. Dietary interventions have been successful in altering abundance, composition, and activity of gut microbiota that are relevant for food metabolism and glycaemic control. In addition, mobile apps and wearable devices facilitate real-time assessment of dietary intake and provide feedback which can improve glycaemic control and diabetes management. By integrating these technologies with big data analytics, precision nutrition has the potential to provide personalised nutrition guidance for more effective prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Despite these technological advances, much research is needed before precision nutrition can be widely used in clinical and public health settings. Currently, the field of precision nutrition faces challenges including a lack of robust and reproducible results, the high cost of omics technologies, and methodological issues in study design as well as high-dimensional data analyses and interpretation. Evidence is needed to support the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and additional benefits of precision nutrition beyond traditional nutrition intervention approaches. Therefore, we should manage unrealistically high expectations and balance the emerging field of precision nutrition with public health nutrition strategies to improve diet quality and prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications.",pubmed

Functional foods contain biologically active ingredients associated with physiological health benefits for preventing and managing chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A regular consumption of functional foods may be associated with enhanced anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, insulin sensitivity, and anti-cholesterol functions, which are considered integral to prevent and manage T2DM. Components of the Mediterranean diet (MD)-such as fruits, vegetables, oily fish, olive oil, and tree nuts-serve as a model for functional foods based on their natural contents of nutraceuticals, including polyphenols, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, sterols, pigments, and unsaturated fatty acids. Polyphenols within MD and polyphenol-rich herbs-such as coffee, green tea, black tea, and yerba maté-have shown clinically-meaningful benefits on metabolic and microvascular activities, cholesterol and fasting glucose lowering, and anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation in high-risk and T2DM patients. However, combining exercise with functional food consumption can trigger and augment several metabolic and cardiovascular protective benefits, but it is under-investigated in people with T2DM and bariatric surgery patients. Detecting functional food benefits can now rely on an ""omics"" biological profiling of individuals' molecular, genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, but is under-investigated in multi-component interventions.

Even in prediabetic state, improving diet and physical activity can slow down or even stop progression to diabetes. In the view of health burden of diabetes it is essential to thoroughly investigate the risk factors and develop more specific preventive strategies. Recently published studies focus on food groups rather than individual products to assess the link between nutrition and risk of type 2 diabetes. Identifying food groups of possible beneficial and deleterious effect on the risk of type 2 diabetes could facilitate the dietary counselling. The aim of the overview is to summarize the possible association between consumption of food groups on the risk of type 2 diabetes on the basis of available literature. Observations from studies and meta-analyses indicate on an inverse association between consumption of fresh vegetables and fruit, whole grains, lean dairy, fish, nuts and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Food groups that seemed to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes are: red and processed meat, refined grains, sugar-sweetened beverages.

We aimed to assess the long-term effects of lifestyle interventions in people with impaired glucose tolerance on the incidence of diabetes, its complications, and mortality. The original study was a cluster randomised trial, started in 1986, in which 33 clinics in Da Qing, China, were randomly assigned to either be a control clinic or provide one of three interventions (diet, exercise, or diet plus exercise) for 6 years for 577 adults with impaired glucose tolerance who usually receive their medical care from the clinics. Subsequently, participants were followed for up to 30 years to assess the effects of intervention on the incidence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease events, composite microvascular complications, cardiovascular disease death, all-cause mortality, and life expectancy. Of the 577 participants, 438 were assigned to an intervention group and 138 to the control group (one refused baseline examination). After 30 years of follow-up, 540 (94%) of 576 participants were assessed for outcomes (135 in the control group, 405 in the intervention group). During the 30-year follow-up, compared with control, the combined intervention group had a median delay in diabetes onset of 3·96 years (95% CI 1·25 to 6·67; p=0·0042), fewer cardiovascular disease events (hazard ratio 0·74, 95% CI 0·59-0·92; p=0·0060), a lower incidence of microvascular complications (0·65, 0·45-0·95; p=0·025), fewer cardiovascular disease deaths (0·67, 0·48-0·94; p=0·022), fewer all-cause deaths (0·74, 0·61-0·89; p=0·0015), and an average increase in life expectancy of 1·44 years (95% CI 0·20-2·68; p=0·023).

The role of lifestyle factors and their relative contributions to the development and mortality of cardio-renal-metabolic multimorbidity (CRMM) remains unclear. A study was conducted with 357,554 UK Biobank participants. CRMM was defined as the coexistence of two or three cardio-renal-metabolic diseases (CRMDs), including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The prospective study examined the associations of individual and combined lifestyle scores (diet, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep duration and social connection) with longitudinal progression from healthy to first cardio-renal-metabolic disease (FCRMD), then to CRMM, and ultimately to death, using a multistate model. Subsequently, quantile G-computation was employed to assess the relative contribution of each lifestyle factor. During a median follow-up of 13.62 years, lifestyle played crucial role in all transitions from healthy to FCRMD, then to CRMM, and ultimately to death. The hazard ratios (95% CIs) per score increase were 0.91 (0.90, 0.91) and 0.90 (0.89, 0.91) for healthy to FCRMD, and for FCRMD to CRMM, and 0.84 (0.83, 0.86), 0.87 (0.86, 0.89), and 0.90 (0.88, 0.93) for mortality risk from healthy, FCRMD, and CRMM, respectively.

High-risk diet contributed the largest proportion to the risk of transition from FCRMD to CRMM, with 22.53%. Less-frequent social connection contributed the largest proportion to the risk of transition from FCRMD to death, with 28.81%. When we further consider the disease-specific transitions, we find that lifestyle scores had slightly stronger associations with development to T2D than to CVD or CKD.

A healthy lifestyle has been widely recommended for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. However, no systematic review has summarised the relationship between combined lifestyle factors (including, but not limited to, smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity, diet and being overweight or obese) and incident type 2 diabetes and risk of health outcomes among diabetic individuals. EMBASE and PubMed were searched up to April 2019 without language restrictions. References included in articles in relevant publications were also screened. Cohort studies investigating the combined associations of at least three lifestyle factors with incident type 2 diabetes and health outcomes among diabetic individuals were included. Reviewers were paired and independently screened studies, extracted data and evaluated study quality. Random-effects models were used to calculate summary HRs. Heterogeneity and publication bias tests were also conducted. Compared with participants considered to have the least-healthy lifestyle, those with the healthiest lifestyle had a 75% lower risk of incident diabetes (HR 0.25 [95% CI 0.18, 0.35]; 14 studies with approximately 1 million participants). The associations were largely consistent and significant among individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds and baseline characteristics. Among individuals with type 2 diabetes (10 studies with 34,385 participants), the HRs (95% CIs) were 0.44 (0.33, 0.60) for all-cause death, 0.51 (0.30, 0.86) for cardiovascular death, 0.69 (0.47, 1.00) for cancer death and 0.48 (0.37, 0.63) for incident cardiovascular disease when comparing the healthiest lifestyle with the least-healthy lifestyle. Adoption of a healthy lifestyle is associated with substantial risk reduction in type 2 diabetes and long-term adverse outcomes among diabetic individuals. Tackling multiple risk factors, instead of concentrating on one certain lifestyle factor, should be the cornerstone for reducing the global burden of type 2 diabetes.",pubmed

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease shaped by genetic and environmental factors, including the gut microbiome. Recent research revealed pathophysiological heterogeneity and distinct subgroups in both T2D and prediabetes, prompting exploration of personalized risk factors. Using metabolomics in two Swedish cohorts (n = 1,167), we identified over 500 blood metabolites associated with impaired glucose control, with approximately one-third linked to an altered gut microbiome. Our findings identified metabolic disruptions in microbiome-metabolome dynamics as potential mediators of compromised glucose homeostasis, as illustrated by the potential interactions between Hominifimenecus microfluidus and Blautia wexlerae via hippurate. Short-term lifestyle changes, for example, diet and exercise, modulated microbiome-associated metabolites in a lifestyle-specific manner. This study suggests that the microbiome-metabolome axis is a modifiable target for T2D management, with optimal health benefits achievable through a combination of lifestyle modifications.",pubmed

The epidemic of obesity is growing steadily across the whole world. Obesity is not only a merely aesthetic disease but is the ""mother"" of most chronic diseases such as associated with a range of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. However, although there is a need to find a strategy to stop this epidemic disease, most of the times the current nutritional strategies are not effective in weight loss and in long term weight maintenance. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is increasingly establishing as a successful nutritional pattern to manage obesity; this is due to rapid weight loss that gives rise to a positive psychological cycle which in turn increases the compliance to diet. Another important key point of VLCKD is the ability to preserve fatty free mass which is known to play a role of paramount importance in glucose metabolism. Despite the clinical evidence of VLCKD there are paucity of data regarding to its management. Therefore, we will provide a useful guide to be used by nutrition experts taking care of subjects with obesity. In particular, we will report recommendations on the correct use of this therapeutic approach for weight loss and management of side effects.",pubmed

The 2021 consensus report on the definition and interpretation of remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been released. Although intermittent fasting diets (IF) are becoming very popular, no studies have investigated their benefit in diabetes remission. The present study examined the effectiveness of IF in diabetes remission and potential remission durability. Participants between ages 38 and 72 years with a duration of T2D of 1 to 11 years, a body mass index (BMI) of 19.1 to 30.4, 66.7% male, and antidiabetic agent use and/or insulin injection were randomly allocated at a ratio of 1:1 to the Chinese Medical Nutrition Therapy (CMNT) or control group. The primary outcome was diabetes remission, defined as a stable glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of less than 48 mmol/mol (< 6.5%) for at least 3 months after discontinuing all antidiabetic medications. The secondary outcomes included HbA1c level, fasting blood glucose level, blood pressure, weight, quality of life, and medication costs. We conducted a 12-month follow-up to assess the continuation of remission. On completing the 3-month intervention plus 3-month follow-up, 47.2% (17/36) of participants achieved diabetes remission in the CMNT group, whereas only 2.8% (1/36) of individuals achieved remission in the control group (odds ratio 31.32; 95% CI, 2.39-121.07; P < 0.0001). The mean body weight of participants in the CMNT group was reduced by 5.93 kg (SD 2.47) compared to 0.27 kg (1.43) in the control group. After the 12-month follow-up, 44.4% (16/36) of the participants achieved sustained remission, with an HbA1c level of 6.33% (SD 0.87). The medication costs of the CMNT group were 77.22% lower than those of the control group (60.4/month vs 265.1/month).

Secondary questions are: What are the lipid (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) outcomes from lifestyle weight-loss interventions resulting in weight losses greater than or less than 5% at 12 months? And, what are the weight and metabolic outcomes from differing amounts of macronutrients in weight-loss interventions? Inclusion criteria included randomized clinical trial implementing weight-loss interventions in overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes, minimum 12-month study duration, a 70% completion rate, and an HbA1c value reported at 12 months. Eleven trials (eight compared two weight-loss interventions and three compared a weight-loss intervention group with a usual care/control group) with 6,754 participants met study criteria. At 12 months, 17 study groups (8 categories of weight-loss intervention) reported weight loss <5% of initial weight (-3.2 kg [95% CI: -5.9, -0.6]). A meta-analysis of the weight-loss interventions reported nonsignificant beneficial effects on HbA1c, lipids, or blood pressure. Two study groups reported a weight loss of ≥5%: a Mediterranean-style diet implemented in newly diagnosed adults with type 2 diabetes and an intensive lifestyle intervention implemented in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial. Both included regular physical activity and frequent contact with health professionals and reported significant beneficial effects on HbA1c, lipids, and blood pressure. Five trials (10 study groups) compared weight-loss interventions of differing amounts of macronutrients and reported nonsignificant differences in weight loss, HbA1c, lipids, and blood pressure. The majority of lifestyle weight-loss interventions in overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes resulted in weight loss <5% and did not result in beneficial metabolic outcomes. A weight loss of >5% appears necessary for beneficial effects on HbA1c, lipids, and blood pressure. Achieving this level of weight loss requires intense interventions, including energy restriction, regular physical activity, and frequent contact with health professionals. Weight loss for many overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes might not be a realistic primary treatment strategy for improved glycemic control.

The association between an overall healthy lifestyle and the subsequent risk of microvascular complications among patients with diabetes remains unclear. To examine the association between adherence to a healthy lifestyle before and after diabetes diagnosis and the risk of subsequent microvascular complications among adults with diabetes. This prospective cohort study included incident patients with type 2 diabetes who were free of cardiovascular disease and cancer at the time of diabetes diagnosis and completed the diabetes supplementary questionnaires in the Nurses' Health Study (in 2000 and 2005) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (in 2000, 2004, and 2008) in the US. Data were analyzed from April to August 2021. Diet and lifestyle factors before and after diabetes diagnosis were assessed by validated questionnaires. A healthy lifestyle consisted of nonsmoking, having a healthy body weight (a body mass index of ≥18.5 or <25), engaging in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (≥150 minutes per week), consuming a high-quality diet (top 40th percentile of the Alternative Healthy Eating Index), and moderate alcohol drinking (5-15 g/d for women and 5-30 g/d for men). Physician-diagnosed microvascular complications including diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and foot disorders were self-reported at questionnaire surveys. A total of 7077 patients with type 2 diabetes were included in the cohort (4982 women in NHS and 2095 men in HPFS, mean [SD] age 61 [8.8], 94.2% White). During follow-up, 2878 patients developed microvascular complications. After multivariable adjustment, adherence to a healthy lifestyle before and after diabetes diagnosis were both associated with a lower risk of developing microvascular complications. The relative risk (RR) for participants with 4 or more low-risk lifestyle factors before diabetes diagnosis compared with zero was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.60-0.91) for any microvascular complications, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.54-0.93) for diabetic neuropathy, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.57-1.01) for diabetic retinopathy, 0.42 (95% CI, 0.23-0.79) for diabetic nephropathy, and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.35-1.00) for diabetic foot disorders. Similar results were observed for adherence to a healthy lifestyle after diabetes diagnosis, with an RR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.55-0.83) for any microvascular complications, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.51-0.88) for diabetic neuropathy, 0.65 (95% CI, 0.48-0.86) for diabetic retinopathy, 0.57 (95% CI, 0.34-0.98) for diabetic nephropathy, and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.37-1.05) for diabetic foot disorders. In addition, greater improvement in lifestyle factors from before to after diabetes diagnosis was also significantly associated with a lower risk of neuropathy or total microvascular complications. Each increment in number of low-risk lifestyle factors was associated with a 6% (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.98) lower risk for any microvascular complications and a 9% (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.96) lower risk for diabetic neuropathy. Consistent results were observed when analyses were stratified by age at diabetes diagnosis, sex/cohort, or lifestyle factors before diabetes diagnosis.

We aimed to investigate the association between polysocial risk score (PsRS), an estimator of individual-level exposure to cumulative social risks, and incident type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank study. This study includes 319,832 participants who were free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline in the UK Biobank study. The PsRS was calculated by counting the 12 social determinants of health from three social risk domains (namely socioeconomic status, psychosocial factors, and neighbourhood and living environment) that had a statistically significant association with incident type 2 diabetes after Bonferroni correction. A healthy lifestyle score was calculated using information on smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, diet quality and sleep quality. A genetic risk score was calculated using 403 SNPs that showed significant genome-wide associations with type 2 diabetes in people of European descent. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyse the association between the PsRS and incident type 2 diabetes. During a median follow-up period of 8.7 years, 4427 participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. After adjustment for major confounders, an intermediate PsRS (4-6) and high PsRS (≥7) was associated with higher risks of developing type 2 diabetes with the HRs being 1.38 (95% CI 1.26, 1.52) and 2.02 (95% CI 1.83, 2.22), respectively, compared with those with a low PsRS (≤3). In addition, an intermediate to high PsRS accounted for approximately 34% (95% CI 29, 39) of new-onset type 2 diabetes cases. A healthy lifestyle slightly, but significantly, mitigated PsRS-related risks of type 2 diabetes (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.030). In addition, the additive interactions between PsRS and genetic predisposition led to 15% (95% CI 13, 17; p<0.001) of new-onset type 2 diabetes cases (p<sub>interaction</sub><0.001).

To address this, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based nutritionist program that uses advanced language and image recognition models was created. This program can identify ingredients from images of a patient's meal and offer nutritional guidance and dietary recommendations. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the competence of the models that support this program. The potential of an AI nutritionist program for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was evaluated through a multistep process. First, a survey was conducted among patients with T2DM and endocrinologists to identify knowledge gaps in dietary practices. ChatGPT and GPT 4.0 were then tested through the Chinese Registered Dietitian Examination to assess their proficiency in providing evidence-based dietary advice. ChatGPT's responses to common questions about medical nutrition therapy were compared with expert responses by professional dietitians to evaluate its proficiency. The model's food recommendations were scrutinized for consistency with expert advice. A deep learning-based image recognition model was developed for food identification at the ingredient level, and its performance was compared with existing models. Finally, a user-friendly app was developed, integrating the capabilities of language and image recognition models to potentially improve care for patients with T2DM. Most patients (182/206, 88.4%) demanded more immediate and comprehensive nutritional management and education. Both ChatGPT and GPT 4.0 passed the Chinese Registered Dietitian examination. ChatGPT's food recommendations were mainly in line with best practices, except for certain foods like root vegetables and dry beans. Professional dietitians' reviews of ChatGPT's responses to common questions were largely positive, with 162 out of 168 providing favorable reviews.

The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity has been steadily increasing over the past four decades, with projections indicating a significant rise in the number of affected individuals by 2045. Therapeutic interventions in T2DM aim to control blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of complications. Dietary and lifestyle modifications play a crucial role in the management of T2DM and obesity. While conventional medical nutritional therapy (MNT) often promotes a high-carbohydrate, low-fat Mediterranean diet as an elective treatment, low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs), specifically those restricting carbohydrate intake to less than 130 g/day, have gained popularity due to their multifaceted benefits. Scientific research supports the efficacy of LCDs in improving glycemic control, weight loss, blood pressure, lipid profiles, and overall quality of life. However, sustaining these benefits over the long term remains challenging. This trial aimed to compare the effects of a Mediterranean diet vs. a low-carbohydrate diet (carbohydrate intake < 130 g/day) on overweight/obese patients with T2DM over a 16-week period. The study will evaluate the differential effects of these diets on glycemic regulation, weight reduction, lipid profile, and cardiovascular risk factors. The study population comprises 100 overweight/obese patients with poorly controlled T2DM. Anthropometric measurements, bioimpedance analysis, and blood chemistry assessments will be conducted at baseline and after the 16-week intervention period. Both dietary interventions were hypocaloric, with a focus on maintaining a 500 kcal/day energy deficit. After 16 weeks, both diets had positive effects on various parameters, including weight loss, blood pressure, glucose control, lipid profile, and renal function. However, the low-carbohydrate diet appears to result in a greater reduction in BMI, blood pressure, waist circumference, glucose levels, lipid profiles, cardiovascular risk, renal markers, and overall metabolic parameters compared to the Mediterranean diet at the 16-week follow up. These findings suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet may be more effective than a Mediterranean diet in promoting weight loss and improving various metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight/obese patients with T2DM. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to understand the clinical implications and long-term sustainability of these findings.",pubmed

The gut microbiota plays a fundamental role in human nutrition and metabolism and may have direct implications for type 2 diabetes and associated preconditions. An improved understanding of relations between human gut microbiota and glucose metabolism could lead to novel opportunities for type 2 diabetes prevention, but human observational studies reporting on such findings have not been extensively reviewed. Here, we review the literature on associations between gut microbiota and markers and stages of glucose dysregulation and insulin resistance in healthy adults and in adults with metabolic disease and risk factors. We present the current evidence for identified key bacteria and their potential roles in glucose metabolism independent of overweight, obesity, and metabolic drugs. We provide support for SCFAs mediating such effects and discuss the role of diet, as well as metabolites derived from diet and gut microbiota interactions. From 5983 initially identified PubMed records, 45 original studies were eligible and reviewed. α Diversity and 45 bacterial taxa were associated with selected outcomes. Six taxa were most frequently associated with glucose metabolism: Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium longum, Clostridium leptum group, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Faecalibacterium (inversely associated) and Dorea (directly associated). For Dorea and A. muciniphila, associations were independent of metabolic drugs and body measures. For A. muciniphila and F. prausnitzii, limited evidence supported SCFA mediation of potential effects on glucose metabolism. We conclude that observational studies applying metagenomics sequencing to identify species-level relations are warranted, as are studies accounting for confounding factors and investigating SCFA and postprandial glucose metabolism. Such advances in the field will, together with mechanistic and prospective studies and investigations into diet-gut microbiota interactions, have the potential to bring critical insight into roles of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in human glucose metabolism and to contribute toward the development of novel prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes, including precision nutrition.",pubmed

Self-reported adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been modestly inversely associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in cohort studies. There is uncertainty about the validity and magnitude of this association due to subjective reporting of diet. The association has not been evaluated using an objectively measured biomarker of the Mediterranean diet. We derived a biomarker score based on 5 circulating carotenoids and 24 fatty acids that discriminated between the Mediterranean or habitual diet arms of a parallel design, 6-month partial-feeding randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted between 2013 and 2014, the MedLey trial (128 participants out of 166 randomised). We applied this biomarker score in an observational study, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct case-cohort study, to assess the association of the score with T2D incidence over an average of 9.7 years of follow-up since the baseline (1991 to 1998). We included 22,202 participants, of whom 9,453 were T2D cases, with relevant biomarkers from an original case-cohort of 27,779 participants sampled from a cohort of 340,234 people. As a secondary measure of the Mediterranean diet, we used a score estimated from dietary-self report. Within the trial, the biomarker score discriminated well between the 2 arms; the cross-validated C-statistic was 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.94). The score was inversely associated with incident T2D in EPIC-InterAct: the hazard ratio (HR) per standard deviation of the score was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.77) following adjustment for sociodemographic, lifestyle and medical factors, and adiposity. In comparison, the HR per standard deviation of the self-reported Mediterranean diet was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86 to 0.95). Assuming the score was causally associated with T2D, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet in Western European adults by 10 percentiles of the score was estimated to reduce the incidence of T2D by 11% (95% CI: 7% to 14%). The study limitations included potential measurement error in nutritional biomarkers, unclear specificity of the biomarker score to the Mediterranean diet, and possible residual confounding. These findings suggest that objectively assessed adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower risk of T2D and that even modestly higher adherence may have the potential to reduce the population burden of T2D meaningfully.

Growing evidence suggests that certain dietary strategies can exert direct metabolic benefits independent of weight reduction. The Mediterranean diet has consistently demonstrated metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, along with improved glycaemic control, even in the absence of substantial weight reduction. Low-energy and very-low-energy diets, characterized by moderate to severe caloric restriction, respectively, have also been associated with improvements in cardiometabolic markers and glycaemic regulation. Ketogenic diets promote nutritional ketosis and have shown benefits on glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity and other metabolic outcomes, often preceding substantial weight loss.

Starch, a significant source of carbohydrates, is categorized as rapidly digestible, slowly digestible, or resistant starch (RS). RS, which is a non-viscous fermentable fiber, has shown promise in animal studies for antidiabetic effects by improving glucose metabolism. Although the exact mechanism by which RS affects glucose metabolism remains unclear, it is expected to positively impact glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The fermentation of RS by colonic microbiota in the large bowel produces short-chain fatty acids, which exert multiple metabolic effects on glucose regulation and homeostasis. Moreover, RS may influence glucose metabolism via bile acid modulation, independent of its fermentation. Diets rich in RS could aid in blood glucose homeostasis. However, it is uncertain whether they can alter the metabolic pathology associated with glucose regulation. In essence, RS has the potential to lower postprandial glucose levels similarly to a low-glycemic index diet. Yet, its efficacy as a medical nutrition therapy for type 2 diabetes needs further investigation. To confirm the role of RS in glycemic control and to possibly recommend it as an additional dietary approach for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a well-designed, large-scale intervention is required.",pubmed

The influence of environmental factors on type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk is now well recognized and highlights the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms. This review will focus on the role of epigenetic factors in the risk and pathogenesis of T2D. Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as a key mechanism underpinning the pathogenesis of T2D and its complications. Environmental variations, including alterations in lifestyle, nutrition, and metabolic demands during prenatal and postnatal life can induce epigenetic changes that may impact glucose homeostasis and the function of different metabolic organs. Accumulating data continues to uncover the specific pathways that are epigenetically dysregulated in T2D, providing an opportunity for therapeutic targeting. Environmental changes can disrupt specific epigenetic mechanisms underlying metabolic homeostasis, thus contributing to T2D pathogenesis. Such epigenetic changes can be transmitted to the next generation, contributing to the inheritance of T2D risk. Recent advances in epigenome-wide association studies and epigenetic editing tools present the attractive possibility of identifying epimutations associated with T2D, correcting specific epigenetic alterations, and designing novel epigenetic biomarkers and interventions for T2D.",pubmed

In a parallel groups design, 51 adults (35-65 y) with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and overweight/obesity (HbA1c ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol), BMI ≥25-≤40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) commenced a six-month intervention. Following baseline, participants were randomised to TRE (1000-1900 h) or DIET (individualised dietetic guidance) with four consultations over four months. Changes in HbA1c (primary), body composition, and self-reported adherence (secondary) were analysed using linear mixed models. A non-inferiority margin of 0.3% (4 mmol/mol) HbA1c was set a priori. Forty-three participants (56 ± 8 y, BMI: 33 ± 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, HbA1c: 7.6 ± 0.8%) completed the intervention. HbA1c was reduced (P=0.002; TRE: -0.4% (-5 mmol/mol), DIET: -0.3% (-4 mmol/mol)) with no group or interaction effects; TRE was non-inferior to DIET (-0.11%, 95%CI: -0.50% to 0.28%).

Biomedical and lifestyle factors in Western populations have significantly shifted in recent decades, influencing public health and contributing to the increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) that share inflammation as common pathology. We investigated the relationship between these factors and 11 NCDs in the cross-sectional FoCus cohort (n = 1220), using logistic regression models. Associations with age-at-disease-onset were specifically analyzed for type 2 diabetes (T2D, low-grade chronic inflammation) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, high-grade chronic inflammation) in disease-specific cohorts (FoCus-T2D, n = 514; IBD-KC, n = 1110). Important factors for disease risk were identified using Cox-PH-regression models and time-to-event analysis. We further explored the interaction between identified risk factors and gut microbiome composition using linear models. Lifestyle factors were clearly linked to disease phenotypes, particularly in T2D and IBD. Still, some factors affected only the age-at-onset, but not disease prevalence. High-quality nutrition significantly delayed onset for both IBD and T2D (IBD: HR = 0.81 [0.66; 0.98]; T2D: HR = 0.45 [0.28; 0.72]). Smoking accelerated T2D onset (HR = 1.82 [1.25; 2.65]) but delayed onset in ulcerative colitis (UC: HR = 0.47 [0.28; 0.79]). Higher microbiota diversity delayed IBD onset (Shannon: HR = 0.58 [0.49; 0.71]) but had no effect on T2D. The abundance of specific microbial genera was strongly associated with various biomedical and lifestyle factors in T2D and IBD. In unaffected controls, these effects were smaller or reversed, potentially indicating a greater susceptibility of the gut microbiome to negative influences in T2D and IBD. The dual insights into age-at-disease-onset and gut microbiota composition in disease emphasize the role of certain biomedical and lifestyle factors, e.g., nutrition quality, in disease prevention and management. Understanding these relationships provides a foundation for developing targeted strategies to mitigate the impact of metabolic and inflammatory diseases through lifestyle modifications and gut health management.",pubmed

We included 287 men from the Men's Lifestyle Validation Study, a substudy of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS), who provided up to two pairs of faecal samples and two blood samples. Diet was assessed using 7-day diet records. Associations between plasma concentrations of tryptophan metabolites and T2D CHD risk were examined in 13 032 participants from Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHSII and HPFS. We identified 17 microbial species whose abundance was significantly associated with plasma IPA concentrations. A significant association between higher tryptophan intake and higher IPA concentrations was only observed among men who had higher fibre intake and a higher microbial species score consisting of the 17 species (p-interaction<0.01). Dietary and plasma concentrations of tryptophan and most kynurenine pathway metabolites were positively associated with T2D risk (HR<sub>Q5 vs Q1</sub> ranged from 1.17 to 1.46) while a significant inverse association was found for IPA (HR<sub>Q5 vs Q1</sub> (95% CI) 0.70 (0.56 to 0.88)).

The broadening field of research in the effect of low glycemic index (GI) and/or glycemic load (GL) diets on individuals with T2DM has yielded promising results in the existing literature. Adopting low-GI and GL dietary patterns contributes to minimizing fluctuations in blood glucose levels, thus presenting a good strategy for achieving enhanced glycemic control. Furthermore, the above dietary practices may offer a viable alternative and practical approach to weight management in individuals with T2DM.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder with a heterogeneous etiology encompassing societal and behavioral risk factors in addition to genetic and environmental susceptibility. The cardiovascular consequences of diabetes account for more than two-thirds of mortality among people with T2D. Not only does T2D shorten life expectancy, but it also lowers quality of life and is associated with extremely high health expenditures since diabetic complications raise both direct and indirect healthcare costs. An increasing body of research indicates a connection between T2D and gut microbial traits, as numerous alterations in the intestinal microorganisms have been noted in pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals. These include pro-inflammatory bacterial patterns, increased intestinal permeability, endotoxemia, and hyperglycemia-favoring conditions, such as the alteration of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. Restoring microbial homeostasis can be very beneficial for preventing and co-treating T2D and improving antidiabetic therapy outcomes. This review summarizes the characteristics of a ""diabetic"" microbiota and the metabolites produced by microbial species that can worsen or ameliorate T2D risk and progression, suggesting gut microbiota-targeted strategies to restore eubiosis and regulate blood glucose.

The rapid outbreak of type-2 diabetes is one of the largest public health problems around the globe. Particularly, the developing nations are becoming the epicenters of cardiometabolic disorders owing to the change in lifestyle and diet preference besides genetic predisposition. Diabetes has become a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in South Asian countries including India. The pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes primarily initiates with inadequacy of pancreatic islet β-cells to respond to chronic fuel surfeit and hence causing glycemic load, insulin resistance, and obesity. Urban Indian life is threatened with unhealthy high calorie diet and sedentary habits, and thus impairing the metabolic status of ""thin-fat Indians"" and rendering them more vulnerable to metabolic disorders.

In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission proposed a global reference dietary pattern. Although research on the EAT-Lancet reference diet and its associations with mortality, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, dietary environmental impacts, and cost of diets is increasing, studies done in low-income and middle-income countries remain scarce. This study aimed to assess the health outcomes, environmental impacts, and dietary costs of adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet in China. In this health and nutrition survey study, 16 029 participants from the China Health and Nutrition Survey cohort (1997-2015) were included at baseline. All-cause mortality was reported by family members and risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes was self-reported. 3-day 24 h recall was used to assess adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet (Eat-Lancet Diet Index [ELDI]), diet-related environmental impacts (greenhouse-gas emissions [GHGE]), total water use (TWU), land use, and dietary costs in each survey round. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the ELDI-score were obtained by Cox models with time-varying covariates, adjusted for potential confounders. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression was used to assess the association of environmental impacts and dietary costs to the ELDI score. During a median follow-up of 9·86 years, 803 new cases of incident type 2 diabetes, 563 new cases of cardiovascular disease, and 908 cases of all-cause mortality were recorded. At baseline, the ELDI score ranged from 9·4 points to 110·8 points on a scale of 0 to 140, with a mean of 55·3 points (SD 11·8). With each SD increase in the ELDI score, there was an 8% decreased risk of mortality (95% CI 2·2-14·1), a 16·1% decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (9·2-20·3), and a 25·3% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (19·5- 28·4). Each SD increase in the index was associated with a decrease of 2·2% (95% CI -2·6 to -1·8) in GHGE, 2·3% (-2·6 to -2·0) in land use, no association with TWU, but an increase in diet costs of 3·3% (2·8 to 3·8).

If cognitive impairments are not reversed at an early stage of appearance of symptoms, then the prolonged pathogenesis can lead to dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, it is necessary to detect the risk factors and mechanism of prevention of cognitive dysfunction at an early stage of disease. Poor lifestyle, age, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammation are some of the major risk factors that contribute to cognitive and memory impairments in diabetic patients. Mild cognitive impairment was seen in those individuals of type 2 diabetes, who are on an unhealthy diet. Physical inactivity, frequent alcohol consumptions, and use of packed food products that provides an excess of cheap calories are found associated with cognitive impairment and depression in diabetic patients. Omega fatty acids (FAs) and polyphenol-rich foods, especially flavonoids, can reduce the bad effects of an unhealthy lifestyle; therefore, the consumption of omega FAs and flavonoids may be beneficial in maintaining normal cognitive function.

Associations between the identified DMPs and the primary outcome (T2DM), as well as secondary outcomes (fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1c), were determined via logistic and linear regression models, respectively. In the present study population (mean age: 52 ± 10 years; male: 42.6%), the comprehensive lifestyle index showed a significant association with one DMP annotated to an intergenic region on chromosome 7 (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.024). Others were annotated to ADCY7, SMARCE1, AHRR, LOXL2, and PTBP1 genes. One DMR was identified and annotated to the GFPT2 gene (familywise error rate (FWER) from bumphunter bootstrap = 0.036). None of the DMPs showed significant associations with T2DM; directions of effect were positive for the DMP in the AHRR and inverse for all the other DMPs. Higher methylation of the ADCY7 DMP was associated with higher FBG (p = 0.024); LOXL2 DMP was associated with lower FBG (p = 0.023) and HbA1c (p = 0.049); and PTBP1 DMP was associated with lower HbA1c (p = 0.002). In this explorative epigenome-wide association study among Ghanaians, we identified one DMP and DMR associated with a comprehensive lifestyle index not previously associated with individual lifestyle factors. Based on our findings, we infer that lifestyle factors in combination, affect DNA methylation, thereby influencing the risk of T2DM among Ghanaian adults living in different contexts.",pubmed

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex, pervasive disease that creates a health and financial burden. The goal is to head off progression to insulin requirement, and dietary changes have been recognized as a first-line intervention in the treatment protocol. Four evidence-based nutritional options are reviewed and their benefits for metabolic consequences. We conducted a comprehensive search of relevant literature using the PubMed database for recent systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and original research articles. The Mediterranean and plant-based diets have demonstrated benefits for the prevention and treatment of diabetes, weight reduction, lipid improvements, and overall cardiovascular risk reduction. A low carbohydrate diet is another viable option for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction, though it is not as uniformly defined and is difficult to maintain long term. The ketogenic diet is similarly very restrictive and produces significant HbA1c reductions. Type 2 diabetes prevention and treatment is crucial in this widespread disease. The first-line treatment is lifestyle modifications with dietary interventions being at the forefront. With a unique clinical model and a variety of dietary options, our program strives for individualized evidence-based care. Nutritional modifications are the best initial approaches to overcoming insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. All dietary modifications, like any medical intervention, require education on benefits vs risks.",pubmed

Sedentary and high-calorie diets are associated with increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, while exercise and diet control are also important nondrug treatments for diabetes. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an important cytokine, which is mainly expressed in liver, fat and muscle tissue responding to nutrition and exercise, and plays an important role in the improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism. Due to the increasing serum FGF21 level in obesity and diabetes, FGF21 can be used as a predictor or biomarker of diabetes. A variety of clinical antidiabetic drugs can reduce the content of FGF21, possibly for the improvement of FGF21 sensitivity. In this paper, we reviewed the interactions between FGF21 and nondrug therapy (diet and exercise) for diabetes and explored the potential value of the combined application of clinical antidiabetic drugs and FGF21.",pubmed

The driving force behind the current global type 2 diabetes epidemic is insulin resistance in overweight and obese individuals. Dietary factors, physical inactivity, and sedentary behaviors are the major modifiable risk factors for obesity. Nevertheless, many overweight/obese people do not develop diabetes and lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss and diabetes prevention are often ineffective. Traditionally, chronically elevated blood glucose concentrations have been the hallmark of diabetes; however, many individuals will either remain 'prediabetic' or regress to normoglycemia. Thus, there is a growing need for innovative strategies to tackle diabetes at scale. The emergence of biomarker technologies has allowed more targeted therapeutic strategies for diabetes prevention (precision medicine), though largely confined to pharmacotherapy. Unlike most drugs, lifestyle interventions often have systemic health-enhancing effects. Thus, the pursuance of lifestyle precision medicine in diabetes seems rational. Herein, we review the literature on lifestyle interventions and diabetes prevention, describing the biological systems that can be characterized at scale in human populations, linking them to lifestyle in diabetes, and consider some of the challenges impeding the clinical translation of lifestyle precision medicine.",pubmed

Therefore, T2DM patients are at an increased risk for CV disease (CVD). Areas covered: This narrative review discusses the treatment of T2DM. This includes lifestyle measures (diet, exercise and smoking cessation) as well as hypolipidaemic, antihypertensive, weight reducing, antiplatelet and glucose lowering drugs. The focus is on the effects of these therapeutic strategies on CVD risk. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) reporting CVD outcomes with such drugs in T2DM patients are also reviewed. Expert opinion: Apart from current guidelines, the findings of RCTs on CVD outcomes in T2DM patients should be taken into consideration in daily clinical practice. Multiple risk factors should be targeted simultaneously in such high-risk patients in order to efficiently reduce the risk of CV events.",pubmed

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition caused by high blood glucose resulting from insufficient insulin production or cellular resistance to insulin action or both. It is one of the fastest-growing public health concerns worldwide. Development of long-term nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease are some of the complications commonly associated with poor blood glycemic control. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the most prevalent type of diabetes, accounts for around 95 % of all cases globally. Although middle-aged or older adults are more likely to develop T2DM, its prevalence has grown in children and young people due to increased obesity, sedentary lifestyle and poor nutrition. Furthermore, it is believed that more than 50 % of cases go undiagnosed annually. Routine screening is essential to ensure early detection and reduce risk of life-threatening complications. Herein, we review traditional biomarkers and highlight the ongoing pursuit of novel and efficacious biomarkers driven by the objective of achieving early, precise and prompt diagnoses.

Insulin resistance (IR) and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction are core pathophysiologic features of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Select lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions, including weight loss, physical activity, a Mediterranean diet intervention, and hypoglycemic agents, have been shown to prevent or delay T2DM. However, dietary factors other than weight loss may also impact risk, mainly through effects to enhance insulin sensitivity, although some may also directly or indirectly impact pancreatic beta-cell function. A literature review of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted, and the research indicates dietary factors showing promise for reducing T2DM risk include higher intakes of cereal fibers, unsaturated fatty acids, magnesium, and polyphenols (e.g. anthocyanins), while reducing dietary glycemic load, added sugars, and high-sugar beverages. While these dietary factors are mainly supported by evidence from observational studies and RCTs of surrogate markers for T2DM, they are consistent with current recommendations to emphasize consumption of whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, seafood, fruits, and vegetables, while limiting intakes of saturated fatty acids, refined carbohydrates, and processed meats. Additional dietary intervention RCTs are needed to assess the efficacy of these promising dietary interventions for delaying or preventing the onset of T2DM.",pubmed

Adverse health behaviors have been found to play a role in linking socioeconomic deprivation and mortality, but relevant evidence in patients with type 2 diabetes is lacking. We aimed to quantify the mediation effect of overall lifestyles on the association between socioeconomic deprivation and premature mortality as well as the interaction of deprivation and lifestyle in diabetes. This cohort study included 20,463 UK Biobank participants with type 2 diabetes at recruitment between 2006 and 2010. Socioeconomic deprivation level was determined using the Townsend deprivation index. An overall lifestyle score was constructed based on 6 health behaviors including smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diet, sleep duration, and television viewing time. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to investigate the associations of socioeconomic deprivation and lifestyle with premature mortality. Over a mean follow-up of 7.4-12.7 years, 3381, 2382, 1281, and 577 patients with diabetes died before ages 80, 75, 70, and 65 years, respectively. High socioeconomic deprivation showed an association with a higher risk of premature mortality that was partially mediated by overall lifestyles. A significant interaction was found between lifestyle and deprivation on premature mortality, which became more apparent as age at death decreased. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death before age 80 years when comparing the unfavorable versus favorable lifestyle was 1.49 (95% CI 1.21-1.82) in the least deprived group and 1.92 (1.56-2.36) in the most deprived group. Equivalent HRs for death before age 65 years were 1.33 (0.76-2.33) and 3.78 (2.04-7.02), respectively.

This article reviews the clinical evidence supporting precision nutrition as a fundamental approach for dietary advice in diabetes. Further, it proposes a framework for the eventual implementation of precision nutrition and discusses key challenges for the application of this approach in the prevention of diabetes. One implication of this approach is that precision nutrition would not exclude the parallel goal of population-based healthy dietary advice.

To present an overview of reviews of interventions for the prevention of diabetes in women after gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with the overall aim of gaining information in order to establish local interventions. Six databases were searched for quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods systematic reviews. All types of interventions or screening programmes were eligible. The outcomes were effectiveness of reducing diabetes incidence, encouraging healthy behavioural changes and enhancing women's perceptions of their increased risks of developing type 2 diabetes following GDM. Eighteen reviews were included: three on screening programmes and seven on participation and risk perceptions. Interventions promoting physical activity, healthy diet, breastfeeding and antidiabetic medicine reported significantly decreased incidence of postpartum diabetes, up to 34% reduction after any breastfeeding compared to none. Effects were larger if the intervention began early after birth and lasted longer. Participation in screening rose up to 40% with face-to-face recruitment in a GDM healthcare setting. Interventions were mainly based in healthcare settings and involved up to nine health professions, councillors and peer educators, mostly dieticians. Women reported a lack of postpartum care and demonstrated a low knowledge of risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes. Typical barriers to participation were lack of awareness of increased risk and low levels of support from family. Lifestyle interventions or pharmacological treatment postpartum was effective in decreasing diabetes incidence following GDM. Women's knowledge of the risk of diabetes and importance of physical activity was insufficient. Early face-to-face recruitment increased participation in screening.

In this report, we investigated the association between established risk factors and type 2 diabetes (T2D) across 5 distinct ethnic groups and explored differences according to T2D definition within the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study. Using the full MEC, with participants in Hawaii and Los Angeles (N=172,230), we applied Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All participants completed questionnaires asking about demographics, anthropometrics, lifestyle factors, and regular diet. T2D status was determined from self-reported diagnosis/medication and Medicare claims. We assessed the associations between well-established risk factors and T2D in the full cohort, after stratification by ethnic group, according to the T2D definition, and in a biorepository subset. Effect modification by ethnicity was evaluated using Wald's tests. Overall, 46,500 (27%) participants had an incident T2D diagnosis after a mean follow-up of 17.1±6.9 years. All predictors were significantly associated with T2D: overweight (HR=1.74), obesity (HR=2.90), red meat intake (HR=1.15), short (HR=1.04) and long (HR=1.08) sleep duration, and smoking (HR=1.26) predicted a significantly higher T2D incidence, whereas coffee (HR=0.90) and alcohol (HR=0.78) consumption, physical activity (HR=0.89), and diet quality (HR=0.96) were associated with lower T2D incidence. The strength of these associations was similar across ethnic groups with noteworthy disparities for overweight/obesity, physical activity, alcohol intake, coffee consumption, and diet quality. These findings confirm the importance of known risk factors for T2D across ethnic groups, but small differences were detected that may contribute to disparate incidence rates in some ethnic groups, especially for obesity and physical activity.",pubmed

Family support in terms of diet may be linked with gender and the assumption that meal preparation is a traditionally female activity. This article looks at the role of gender in diet management in people with type 2 diabetes and their relatives. Seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 participants (10 people with type 2 diabetes, 13 relatives of people with type 2 diabetes) in Scotland, UK. The aim was to uncover changes people have made to their diet following diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in oneself or a family member. Data were analysed using Framework Approach.<b>Findings:</b> Female relatives were more likely to manage the patient's diet while male relatives provided support but were less likely to monitor the person's diet. Female patients may prioritise the needs of their family while male patients are more likely to rely on their female relatives in terms of diet management.

In order to better understand the events that precede and precipitate the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), several nutritional animal models have been developed. These models are generated by manipulating the diet of either the animal itself, or its mother during her pregnancy, and in comparison to traditional genetic and knock out models, have the advantage that they more accurately reflect the etiology of human T2DM. This chapter will discuss some of the most widely used nutritional models of T2DM: Diet-induced obesity (DIO) in adult rodents, and studies of offspring of mothers fed a low-protein, high-fat and/or high-sugar diet during pregnancy and/or lactation. Several common mechanisms have been identified through which these nutritional manipulations can lead to metabolic disease, including pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, impaired insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, and the excess accumulation of visceral adipose tissue and consequent deposition of nonesterified fatty acids in peripheral tissues. In addition, there is an emerging concept that obesity/poor quality diets result in increased production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from adipose tissue leading to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, and that this is likely to represent an important link between obesity/diet and metabolic dysfunction. The following chapter will discuss the most common nutritional models of T2DM in experimental animals, their application, and relationship to human etiology, and will highlight the important insights these models have provided into the pathogenesis of T2DM.",pubmed

A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus to incorporate studies from 2015 to 2024 on T2DM in youths/adolescents/children, focusing on epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention strategies. Studies on Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) or adult populations were excluded. T2DM is a complex metabolic disorder with various societal, behavioral, environmental, and genetic risk factors. It accounts for one in three new childhood diabetes cases, with rising incidence among American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, and Hispanic/Latino children. The increase in T2DM incidence correlates with growing childhood obesity rates. Early onset significantly raises the risk of complications like retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and obstructive sleep apnea.

We aimed to identify gut microbiota prospectively associated with glycaemic traits and type 2 diabetes in a geographically diverse population, and examined the cross-sectional association of dietary or lifestyle factors with the identified gut microbiota. The China Health and Nutrition Survey is a population-based longitudinal cohort covering 15 provinces/megacities across China. Of the participants in that study, 2772 diabetes-free participants with a gut microbiota profile based on 16S rRNA analysis were included in the present study (age 50.8 ± 12.7 years, mean ± SD). Using a multivariable-adjusted linear mixed-effects model, we examined the prospective association of gut microbiota with glycaemic traits (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA<sub>1c</sub> and HOMA-IR). We constructed a healthy microbiome index (HMI), and used Poisson regression to examine the relationship between the HMI and incident type 2 diabetes. We evaluated the association of dietary or lifestyle factors with the glycaemic trait-related gut microbiota using a multivariable-adjusted linear regression model. After follow-up for 3 years, 123 incident type 2 diabetes cases were identified. We identified 25 gut microbial genera positively or inversely associated with glycaemic traits.

Methods and Results A total of 13 543 participants with baseline type 2 diabetes and free of macrovascular and microvascular diseases from the UK Biobank were included. A healthy lifestyle was determined based on body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, sleep duration, and diet. Life's Essential 8 scores were generated from 8 metrics according to the American Heart Association's cardiovascular health advisory, ranging from 0 to 100. During a median follow-up of 12.1 years, 3279 (24.2%) incident macrovascular diseases and 2557 (18.9%) microvascular diseases were documented. Compared with those with a poor lifestyle, participants with an ideal lifestyle had significantly lower risks of incident macrovascular disease (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46 [95% CI, 0.36-0.59]) and microvascular disease (HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.47-0.77]).

Nearly half of all Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD) also have type-2-diabetes (T2D). Whereas traditional and emerging pharmacotherapies are increasingly frequently used for the management of CKD in diabetes (CKD/DM), the role of integrated or multimodal interventions including the potentially synergistic and additive effect of diet and lifestyle modifications in addition to pharmacotherapy has not been well examined, in sharp contrast to the well-known integrated approaches to heart disease. Low-carbohydrate low-fat diets are often recommended in T2D, whereas low-protein diets (LPD) are recommended by guidelines for nondiabetic CKD with increasing emphasis on plant-based protein sources. High-protein diets with greater animal protein lead to glomerular hyperfiltration, especially in patients with T2D, and faster decline in renal function. Guidelines provide differing recommendations regarding the amount (low vs high) and source (plant vs animal) of dietary protein intake (DPI) in CKD/DM. Some such as KDIGO recommend 0.8 g/kg/day based on insufficient evidence for DPI restriction in CKD/DM, whereas KDOQI and ISRNM recommend a DPI of 0.6 to <0.8 g/kg/day. A patient-centered plant-focused LPD for the nutritional management of CKD/DM (PLAFOND), a type of PLADO diet comprising DPI of 0.6 to <0.8 g/kg/day with >50% plant-based sources, high dietary fiber, low glycemic index, and 25-35 Cal/kg/day energy, can be implemented by renal dietitians under Medical Nutrition Therapy.

Modern lifestyle, genetics, nutritional overload through high-fat diet attributed prevalence and diabetes outcomes with various complications primarily due to obesity in which energy-dense diets frequently affect metabolic health. One possible issue usually associated with elevated chronic fat intake is insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia constitutes an important function in altering the carbohydrates and lipids metabolism. Similarly, in assessing human susceptibility to weight gain and obesity, genetic variations play a central role, contributing to keen interest in identifying the possible role of epigenetics as a mediator of gene-environmental interactions influencing the production of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its related concerns. Epigenetic modifications associated with the acceptance of a sedentary lifestyle and environmental stress factors in response to energy intake and expenditure imbalances complement genetic alterations and lead to the production and advancement of metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. Methylation of DNA, histone modifications, and increases in the expression of non-coding RNAs can result in reduced transcriptional activity of key β-cell genes thus creating insulin resistance. Epigenetics contribute to changes in the expression of the underlying insulin resistance and insufficiency gene networks, along with low-grade obesity-related inflammation, increased ROS generation, and DNA damage in multiorgans. This review focused on epigenetic mechanisms and metabolic regulations associated with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetes mellitus.",pubmed

To summarize key findings of economic evaluations of lifestyle interventions for the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in high-risk subjects. Methods. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed original studies published since January 2009 in English, French, and Spanish. Eligible studies were identified through relevant databases including PubMed, Medline, National Health Services Economic Evaluation, CINHAL, EconLit, Web of sciences, EMBASE, and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature.

The heterogeneity of lifestyle interventions precluded a meta-analysis. Results. Overall, 20 studies were retained, including six focusing on obesity control. Seven were conducted within trials and 13 using modeling techniques. T2D prevention by physical activity or diet or both proved cost-effective according to accepted thresholds, except for five inconclusive studies, three on diabetes prevention and two on obesity control.

While weight loss has been consistently associated with the prevention of T2DM and improvements in glycemic control in those with established diseases, its role in preventing and treating CVD is less clear. In fact, in this setting, improvements in diet quality have provided greater benefits, suggesting that this might represent an alternative, or an even more effective strategy than energy-restriction. Improvements in diet quality, with and without caloric restriction have been shown to improve CVD risk and to prevent the development of T2DM in individuals at risk; however, with regard to glycemic control in patients with T2DM, any dietary intervention resulting in significant weight loss may produce clinically meaningful benefits.

Weight loss is recommended for improving glycemic control and reducing cardiovascular risk factors in persons with diabetes. However, both diabetes and weight loss have been associated with detrimental skeletal health. This review aims to summarize recent study findings on the effects of lifestyle interventions for weight loss on skeletal health among persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D). A few large-scale observational studies have demonstrated an increased fragility fracture risk associated with weight loss among persons with T2D. Randomized control trials in persons with T2D also have shown that intentional lifestyle interventions for weight loss are associated with a greater decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) and an increase in the risk of fracture. The biological mechanisms underlying the compromised bone health during lifestyle interventions for weight loss are complex and not yet conclusive. However, there is evidence to suggest that bone loss and increased fracture risk during intentional weight loss may be mitigated by some intervention approaches, such as high protein intake, calcium supplementation, and resistance and balance training. There is still a lack of studies investigating the effects of different interventions for weight loss on skeletal health among persons with T2D.

The past decades have seen a rapid global rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. This surge has been driven by diabetogenic environmental changes that may act together with a genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes. It is possible that there is a synergistic gene-environment interaction, where the effects of the diabetogenic environment depend on the genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes. Randomised trials have shown that it is possible to delay, or even prevent the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals at elevated risk through behavioural modification, focusing on weight loss, physical activity and diet. There is wide heterogeneity between individuals regarding the effectiveness of these interventions, which could, in part, be due to genetic differences. However, the studies of gene-environment interactions performed thus far suggest that behavioural modifications appear equally effective in reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes from the stage of impaired glucose tolerance, regardless of the known underlying genetic predisposition. Recent studies suggest that there may be several subtypes of type 2 diabetes, which give new opportunities for gaining insight into gene-environment interactions. At present, the role of gene-environment interactions in the development of type 2 diabetes remains unclear. With many puzzle pieces missing in the general picture of type 2 diabetes development, the available evidence of gene-environment interactions is not ready for translation to individualised type 2 diabetes prevention based on genetic profiling.",pubmed

Effective nutrition therapy is a pressing issue in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management. As such, this research aimed to determine the performance of a revised dietary strategy built on the protein-sparing diet in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus with regard to obtaining a rapid and stable improvement in glucometabolic control, body weight, body composition, and energy metabolism when applying the strategy in just twenty-one days. The revised protein-sparing diet differs from the traditional protein-sparing modified fast (PSMF) because it does not include foods. The daily calorie intake of this diet is exclusively derived from Isolate whey protein in addition to a formulation of Isolate whey protein enriched with essential amino acids in free form, with the addition of lipids such as extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil as a source of medium chain fatty acids, where the latter is taken for only the first four days of the diet, together with the use, for the same duration, of extended-release metformin, as the only antihyperglycemic allowed. Anthropometric measurements, bioimpedance analysis, indirect calorimetry, and blood chemistry assessments were conducted at the beginning of the study, time 0 (T0), and at the end, time 1 (T1), i.e., on the 21st day. The main outcomes of the revised protein-sparing diet after only twenty-one days were a reduction in body weight with the predominant loss of visceral atherogenic abdominal fat and, therefore, a possible contextual reduction in ectopic fat deposits together with a simultaneous reduction in insulin resistance and normalization of insulin levels, maintenance of free fat mass and basal metabolism, restoration of metabolic flexibility, and improvement of the glucometabolic and lipidic parameters. These results demonstrate the promising potential of the revised protein-sparing diet as an ""etiologic tool"" in the integrated nutritional treatment of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.",pubmed

Large prospective cohort studies show an association between regular consumption of nuts (>= 140 g per week) and a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. In randomized controlled trials, strong evidence has been obtained that consuming nuts lowers blood cholesterol and improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Recent epidemiological studies show that high nut consumption does not increase body weight; rather, the inclusion of nuts in the hypocaloric diet can help to control or reduce body weight and waist circumference. A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies shows that nut consumption is associated with a reduced risk of death from all causes and from chronic diseases.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic condition with growing worldwide prevalence. Besides genetic factors, a sedentary lifestyle, excess weight, and inadequate eating habits, characterized by an excess intake of refined carbohydrates and ultra-processed foods, are contributing factors for the development of the disease. In this scenario, promoting a plant-based diet, and limiting animal product consumption while increasing the intake of vegetables, concurrently with healthy lifestyle habits, is a promising strategy to prevent T2DM. This scoping review, carried out between 2017 and 2022, aimed to gather evidence substantiating the benefits of a plant-based diet in T2DM prevention, considering different eating patterns, such as vegetarian, vegan, Mediterranean, and DASH diets. Several studies demonstrate a significant reduction in T2DM incidence among individuals adopting plant-based eating patterns or emphasizing healthy plant-based food alongside decreased intake or exclusion of animal-based foods. There are still no robust data regarding plant-based diets and the prevention of diabetes without loss in body weight. Hence, prospective studies in plant-based diets with weight control are needed. Nevertheless, adopting plant-based diets appears to induce significant weight loss, which is crucial in an obesity-endemic context.

Since diabetes and cardiovascular diseases frequently coexist, modern pharmacological therapeutic models aim at addressing both. Therapeutic targets in diabetic population that address glycemic control, adequate lipid and blood pressure control proves to limit the incidence of cardiovascular events, reduce the risk of chronic complications and improve patients quality of life. Similarly, dietary managment in this population should also concentrate on the reduction of reversible cardiovascular risk factors. Nutritional recommendations for diabetic patients should be individualized to meet their expectations and lifestyle in order to ensure compliance and long-term effects.

Globally, the progressive increase in the aging population has led to social and health problems associated with age-related chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and sarcopenia. Recent studies have highlighted that sarcopenia and diabetes have a bidirectional relationship. Nutritional therapy is a key element in the treatment of both sarcopenia and diabetes. To date, there are no nutritional guidelines for the management of sarcopenia in T2DM. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a muscle-targeted nutritional intervention in older people with sarcopenia and type 2 diabetes based on the Italian nutrition guidelines. A total of 211 subjects (117 M and 94 F) affected by T2DM with a mean age of 74 ± 6.0 years were screened for sarcopenia, using EWGSOP2 diagnosis criteria, and enrolled to receive personalized dietary plans with two main targets: a daily energy intake of 25-30 kcal/kg body weight and a daily protein intake of at least 1.1-1.2 g/kg body weight. In total, 34 subjects (24 M and 10 F) were sarcopenic with a prevalence of 16%, which was higher in men. After six months of treatment, handgrip strength increased by 0.83 kg (19.57 ± 5.70 kg vs. 20.40 ± 6.10 kg, <i>p</i> = 0.649), protein intake improved (0.91 ± 0.28 g/kg body weight vs. 1.03 ± 0.40 g/kg body weight, <i>p</i> = 0.115), and the glycated hemoglobin decreased (7.39 ± 0.49% to 6.82 ± 0.98%, <i>p</i> = 0.010). Seven younger subjects had an improvement of sarcopenia with a decrease in HbA1c (7.50 ± 0.59% vs. 6.91 ± 0.79, <i>p</i> = 0.19). The difference over time in the consumption of saturated fatty acids (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.33-1.09, <i>p</i> = 0.096) and simple sugars (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80-1.01, <i>p</i> = 0.090) appeared to be associated with an improvement of sarcopenia status. A total of 177 subjects did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of sarcopenia, and 148 subjects were assessed. The handgrip strength (26.22 ± 9.36 vs. 26.18 ± 9.24 kg, p0.974) and the glycated hemoglobin (7.21 ± 1.07 vs. 7.27 ± 0.98%, <i>p</i> = 0.735) remained stable over time, while protein intake at six months increased (0.81 ± 0.29 vs. 0.91 ± 0.29 g/kg body weight, <i>p</i> = 0.024). Four people were diagnosed with sarcopenia at follow-up, with a lower handgrip strength test result. These subjects were older and had worse glycemic control (HbA1c + 0.5%). Lifestyle modification is important to prevent or reverse the development of the disease. Nutritional therapy in this population is therefore aimed at meeting all nutritional needs and promoting better glycemic control, in terms of glycated hemoglobin, in order to reduce the development of sarcopenia. Although promising, the intervention requires validation in larger studies with control groups.",pubmed

During our whole lifespan, from conception to death, the epigenomes of all tissues and cell types of our body integrate signals from the environment. This includes signals derived from our diet and the uptake of macro- and micronutrients. In most cases, this leads only to transient changes, but some effects of this epigenome programming process are persistent and can even be transferred to the next generation. Both epigenetic programming and redox processes are affected by the individual choice of diet and other lifestyle decisions like physical activity. The nutrient-gene communication pathways have adapted during human evolution and are essential for maintaining health. However, when they are maladaptive, such as in long-term obesity, they significantly contribute to diseases like type 2 diabetes and cancer. The field of nutrigenomics investigates nutrition-related signal transduction pathways and their effect on gene expression involving interactions both with the genome and the epigenomes. Several of these diet-(epi)genome interactions and the involved signal transduction cascades are redox-regulated. Examples include the effects of the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, vitamin C levels and secondary metabolites of dietary molecules from plants on the acetylation and methylation state of the epigenome as well as on gene expression through redox-sensitive pathways via the transcription factors NFE2L2 and FOXO.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance in various tissues. Though conventionally associated with obesity, current research indicates that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is the leading determining factor, wielding more influence regardless of individual body mass. The heightened metabolic activity of VAT encourages the circulation of free fatty acid (FFA) molecules, which induce insulin resistance in surrounding tissues. Individuals most vulnerable to this preferential fat deposition are older males with ancestral ties to Asian countries because genetics and sex hormones are pivotal factors for VAT accumulation. However, interventions in one's diet and lifestyle have the potential to strategically discourage the growth of VAT. This illuminates the possibility that the expansion of VAT and, subsequently, the risk of T2D development are preventable. Therefore, by reducing the amount of VAT accumulated in an individual and preventing it from building up, one can effectively control and prevent the development of T2D.",pubmed

We genotyped 80 genetic variants among 5024 participants without non-communicable diseases at baseline in the Wuxi Non-Communicable Diseases cohort (Wuxi NCDs cohort). During the follow-up period of 14 years, 440 cases of T2D were newly diagnosed. Using Cox regression, we found that the PRS of 46 SNPs identified by the East Asians was relevant to the future T2D. Participants with a high PRS (top quintile) had a two-fold higher risk of T2D than the bottom quintile (hazard ratio: 2.06, 95% confidence interval: 1.42-2.97). Lifestyle factors were considered, including cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, physical exercise, diet, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC). Among high-PRS individuals, the 10-year incidence of T2D slumped from 6.77% to 3.28% for participants having ideal lifestyles (4-6 healthy lifestyle factors) compared with poor lifestyles (0-2 healthy lifestyle factors). When integrating the high PRS, the 10-year T2D risk of low-clinical-risk individuals exceeded that of high-clinical-risk individuals with a low PRS (3.34% vs. 2.91%).

A systematic iterative process was followed to develop the intervention and included five steps: (i) a systematic review of the literature to generate a list of Yogic practices that improves blood glucose levels among adults at high-risk of or with T2DM, (ii) validation of identified Yogic practices by Yoga experts, (iii) development of the intervention, (iv) consultation with Yoga, exercise, physical activity, diet, behavior change, and/or diabetes experts about the intervention, and (v) pretest the intervention among Yoga practitioners and lay people (those at risk of T2DM and had not practiced Yoga before) in India. <b>Results:</b> YOGA-DP is a structured lifestyle education and exercise program, provided over a period of 24 weeks. The exercise part is based on Yoga and includes Shithilikarana Vyayama (loosening exercises), Surya Namaskar (sun salutation exercises), Asana (Yogic poses), Pranayama (breathing practices), and Dhyana (meditation) and relaxation practices. Once participants complete the program, they are strongly encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle in the long-term. <b>Conclusions:</b> We systematically developed a novel Yoga program for T2DM prevention (YOGA-DP) among high-risk people in India.

diabetes_25416725,25416725,diabetes,2015.0,"Mechanisms in endocrinology: Gut microbiota in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.. Perturbations of the composition and function of the gut microbiota have been associated with metabolic disorders including obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Studies on mice have demonstrated several underlying mechanisms including host signalling through bacterial lipopolysaccharides derived from the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, bacterial fermentation of dietary fibres to short-chain fatty acids and bacterial modulation of bile acids. On top of this, an increased permeability of the intestinal epithelium may lead to increased absorption of macromolecules from the intestinal content resulting in systemic immune responses, low-grade inflammation and altered signalling pathways influencing lipid and glucose metabolism. While mechanistic studies on mice collectively support a causal role of the gut microbiota in metabolic diseases, the majority of studies in humans are correlative of nature and thus hinder causal inferences. Importantly, several factors known to influence the risk of type 2 diabetes, e.g. diet and age, have also been linked to alterations in the gut microbiota complicating the interpretation of correlative studies. However, based upon the available evidence, it is hypothesised that the gut microbiota may mediate or modulate the influence of lifestyle factors triggering development of type 2 diabetes. Thus, the aim of this review is to critically discuss the potential role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.",pubmed

The management of diabetes costs in excess of $1.3 trillion per annum worldwide. Diet is central to the management of type 2 diabetes. It is not known whether dietetic intervention is cost effective. This scoping review aimed to map the existing literature concerning the cost effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy provided by dietitians for people with type 2 diabetes. Thirteen scientific databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, as well as multiple official websites, were searched to source peer-reviewed articles, reports, guidelines, dissertations and other grey literature published from 2008 to present. Eligible articles had to have assessed and reported the cost effectiveness of dietetic intervention for adults with type 2 diabetes in developed countries. Experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and qualitative studies were considered. Of 2387 abstracts assessed for eligibility, four studies combining 22 765 adults with type 2 diabetes were included. Dietetic intervention was shown to be cost-effective in terms of diabetes-related healthcare costs and hospital charges, at the same time as also reducing the risk of cumulative days at work lost to less than half and the risk of disability 'sick' days at work to less than one-seventh. The findings highlight the importance of advocacy for medical nutrition therapy for people with type 2 diabetes, with respect to alleviating the great global economic burden from this condition.

Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic condition, generally regarded as an irreversible, that is among the top 10 causes of death globally. The hallmark of T2D is hyperglycemia, which results from disturbances in insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Several clinical and lifestyle factors are involved in the progression of T2D, such as obesity and physical inactivity. A high-calorie diet is the main contributor to the development of obesity, which results in T2D, as obesity or increased intra-abdominal adipose tissue is related to insulin resistance. Technological advances have contributed to individuals having a more sedentary lifestyle, leading to obesity and T2D. T2D can be treated with lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise. Herein, we highlight the positive impact of a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) and lifestyle modalities in the treatment and prevention of T2D. An inclusion of VLCD 400-800 kcal/day for 8 weeks and ≥ 150 minutes exercise 5 times a week as lifestyle interventions can decrease glucose levels to normal, reduce HbA1c and improve insulin resistance and sensitivity. Therefore, a potential mechanism in maintaining glucose homeostasis and remission of T2D by VLCD and exercise reduces body weight.",pubmed

Randomized clinical trials comparing lifestyle intervention with ""usual care"" (control) in type 2 diabetes patients were hand-searched from medical databases by two independent reviewers using the terms ""diabetes, cardiovascular risk, lifestyle, health education, dietary, exercise/physical activities, and behavior intervention"". Of the 235 studies identified, 17 were chosen for the meta-analysis. The average age of patients ranged from 50-67.3 years. Results reveal no significant difference between the groups, with respect to BMI, while PA and DIET yielded a greater reduction in HbA1c. Significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressures in the DIET group, and diastolic pressure in the PA group, was observed. HDL-c in the DIET group was significantly higher than the control group, while no change in LDL-c levels, was seen in all three intervention subtypes. There was no difference between the EDU vs. the control group in terms of HbA1c, blood pressure or HDL-c and LDL-c.

diabetes_34032395,34032395,diabetes,2020.0,"The Role of Vegan Diets in Lipotoxicity-induced Beta-cell Dysfunction in Type-2-Diabetes: A Narrative Review.. Type-2-diabetes is considered the new plague of the current century and its incidence and prevalence are rapidly increasing. Chronic insulin resistance and a progressive decline in beta-cell function are discussed as the root causes of type-2-diabetes. Both are associated with obesity and prolonged exposure to pathologically elevated concentrations of circulating free fatty acid (FFA) levels in the blood. Fatty acid derivatives may interfere with beta-cell function and ultimately lead to their death through lipoapoptosis. The harmful effects of chronically elevated FFA levels on glucose homeostasis and non-adipose tissues are generally referred to as lipotoxicity. Pancreatic beta-cells appear to be particularly vulnerable, and both dietary fat quantity and quality may impact their function. Diets high in saturated fat are especially harmful to beta-cells while (poly-)unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are associated with beta-cell protective effects. Therefore, this narrative review suggests that a dietary modification toward a low-fat vegan diet might help to prevent or reduce lipotoxicity-induced beta-cell dysfunction. By cutting the oversupply of saturated fat and reducing total calorie intake, and by improving both body weight and glycemic control, low-fat vegan diets may reduce the likelihood of lipotoxic events to occur. In light of the accumulating evidence that lipotoxic events are tightly coupled to excess glucose levels, improved glycemic parameters appear to be of utmost importance. These mechanisms are likely to contribute complementarily to improved beta-cell function in individuals with type-2-diabetes who choose a low-fat vegan diet. Physicians must consider these findings when counseling patients on lifestyle modifications and healthy nutrition.",pubmed

Sex differences exist in the prevalence of microvascular disease (MVD) and healthy-lifestyle adherence. Whether MVD and healthy lifestyles are associated with mortality risk similarly for women and men who have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unknown. The present study included 9992 women and 15,860 men with T2DM from the UK Biobank. MVDs included retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and chronic kidney disease. Healthy lifestyle factors consisted of ideal BMI, nonsmoking, healthy diet, regular exercise, and appropriate sleep duration. Sex-specific hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality associated with the MVDs or healthy lifestyles were calculated and women-to-men ratio of HRs (RHR) were further estimated, after multivariable adjustment for potential confounders. During a median of 12.7 years of follow-up, 4346 (1202 in women) all-cause and 1207 (254 in women) CVD deaths were recorded. The adjusted HRs (95% CI) of all-cause mortality for 1 additional increment of the MVDs were 1.71 (1.55, 1.88) for women and 1.48 (1.39, 1.57) for men, with an RHR of 1.16 (1.03, 1.30). The corresponding RHR was 1.36 (1.09, 1.69) for cardiovascular mortality. Adhering to a healthy lifestyle (≥4 vs. ≤1 lifestyle factor) was associated with an approximately 60%-70% lower risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality without sex differences (P-interaction >0.70). Furthermore, as compared with having no MVD and an unfavorable lifestyle, having ≥2 MVDs but a favorable lifestyle was not associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality either in women (HR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.60) or in men (HR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.40), similarly when considering cardiovascular mortality.

To explore the relationship between proinflammatory diet, habitual salt intake and the onset of type 2 diabetes. This prospective study was conducted among 171 094 UK Biobank participants who completed at least one 24-h dietary questionnaire and were free of diabetes at baseline. Participants were followed up until 1 March 2023 for type 2 diabetes incidence, with diagnosis information obtained from linked medical records. An Energy-adjusted Diet Inflammatory Index (E-DII) was calculated based on 28 food parameters. Habitual salt intake was determined through the self-reported frequency of adding salt to foods. The associations between E-DII, habitual salt intake and type 2 diabetes incidence were tested by the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Over a median follow-up period of 13.5 years, 6216 cases of type 2 diabetes were documented. Compared with participants with a low E-DII (indicative of an anti-inflammatory diet), participants with a high E-DII (indicative of a proinflammatory diet) had an 18% heightened risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The association between E-DII and type 2 diabetes tends to be linear after adjustment for major confounders. Participants with a proinflammatory diet and always adding salt to foods had the highest risk of type 2 diabetes incidence (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.32-1.94). Our findings indicate that a proinflammatory diet and higher habitual salt intake were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. These results support the public health promotion of an anti-inflammatory diet and reducing salt intake to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes.",pubmed

Introduction: currently there are changes in lifestyle that have been modifying the nutritional culture, moving away from the Mediterranean diet (DMed) and acquiring a more sedentary lifestyle, a fact that has contributed to a significant increase in risk factors. (CVRF) such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and consequently to a global increase in metabolic syndrome (MS) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which in the 21st century reinforces being the first cause of morbidity and mortality To reduce this pandemic, a multidisciplinary approach is required focused on the application of primary and secondary prevention strategies for modifiable CVRFs, focused on nutritional promotion and education through the promotion of a healthier lifestyle and diet from childhood, as the one that encompasses the MedD. This dietary pattern, together with physical exercise, has been shown to contribute to the primary and secondary prevention of DM2 and coexisting CVRF. Objective: to determine the initial adherence to the DMed in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and to analyze the effects of a nutritional educational intervention from Primary Care on glycemic control and the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet post-intervention and their relationship. Material and methods: descriptive observational study and quasi-experimental analytical study (before-after) in 93 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus with poor glycemic control (A1c ≥ 7 %), carried out in various health centers in Albacete and Cuenca between 2018 and 2019, in which the relationship between adherence to MedDM and CVRF is evaluated, before and after an educational intervention on MedDM. They are administered a data collection sheet that includes a MedD adherence survey (MEDAS-14) at baseline and at 6 months, after completing an education on MedD in Primary Care (PC) medical and nursing consultations). The pre- and post-intervention variables were analyzed: age groups, sex, years of evolution of DM2, body mass index (BMI), as well as basal glycemia (GB) and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c). The main variable ""MEDAS-14"" is related to the rest of the variables. Results: both poor glycemic control and having a high BMI are related to low adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Pre-intervention the score of the survey of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was relatively low (7.44 ± 0.22 points), being in women (7.66 points) than in men (7.1 points). Despite the high consumption of olive oil, a large number of processed products are consumed (sweetened beverages, butter, commercial confectionery), with a low consumption of fruit, fish and nuts. The high levels of basal glycemia are also related to the low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (p < 0.04), as well as the increase in glycosylated hemoglobin (p < 0.06). Post-intervention, adherence to the DMED increased by 1.09 ± 2.56 points (8.55 points). Men being those who present 0.4 points more (8.7 points) than women (8.4 points). The biggest changes have been in relation to the increase in the consumption of white meat, olive oil, nuts, vegetables and stir-fry, and a decrease in the consumption of processed foods. Conclusions: in diabetic patients with poor control, a nutritional educational intervention that promotes MedDM from PC improves adherence to said diet, increasing the consumption of healthy foods and decreasing harmful ones, thus optimizing metabolic control.

Plant-based diets are becoming increasingly popular. Vegetarian diets are better for the environment and exhibit health benefits. A correctly balanced plant-based diet is appropriate at every stage of life. Compared to omnivores, vegetarians consume more fruits and vegetables, more fibre, vitamins C and E, magnesium and less saturated fats. In general, they have better nutrition knowledge, and they are slimmer, healthier and live longer than omnivores. It also seems that following a plant-based diet prevents the onset of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity and some cancers. Food intake has a key influence on insulin resistance. Consumption of calorie-rich and highly processed foods, meats and sweetened beverages is a characteristic element of Western diets. They promote and elevate insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In contrast, intake of pulses and exclusion of meats as well as animal products bring significant benefits to vegetarian diets. According to studies, vegetarians and vegans have better blood parameters, including better glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol levels. Their homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) test results are also better. More plant-based foods and fewer animal foods in a diet result in lower insulin resistance and a lower risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.

Evidence from large-scale randomized controlled trials has established that lifestyle modification (LSM) programs can substantially reduce the risk of diabetes in high-risk individuals. However, routine implementation is limited by high intensity, costs, and resource requirements. We summarize major prevention trials and their effectiveness, feasibility, and limitations. Building on these insights, we introduce the Korean Diabetes Prevention Study (KDPS) as a contextually tailored model for the Korean healthcare system. The KDPS-LSM program was designed to integrate cultural and clinical relevance with practical applicability, consisting of a 6-month intensive phase of structured nutrition and lifestyle education followed by a maintenance phase to support long-term adherence. To promote sustainable change, the program incorporates the '10 habit' lifestyle messages, grounded in the transtheoretical model of behavior change, which are designed for easy implementation in daily life.

In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), sedentary lifestyle, along with food choices and portion sizes, have increased considerably and this has resulted in the soaring risk of diabetes. In addition, there is paucity of literature focusing on the Dietary Knowledge (DK) of type 2 diabetics in KSA. The study aimed to assess and evaluate the DK of type 2 diabetics. An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted among 350 type 2 diabetics using a valid and reliable self-prepared questionnaire comprising of 21 questions. Results showed that type 2 diabetics had an overall poor DK (28.57%). Sub-group analysis further revealed that diabetes patients had poor knowledge related to the consumption of carbohydrates and food choices, whereas they had good knowledge related to lipids and fats, proteins and food types. The role of diet in controlling of diabetes is considered imperative, but still, diabetes patients are unaware how they should approach this issue. The patient empowerment approach can be used to counsel patients with a poor DK. Primary care physicians and dietitians should work together and carry out individualized, tailored and patient-centered dietary education sessions.",pubmed

To investigate whether and what lifestyle factors in later life modify the associations of early-life smoking behaviors and genetic susceptibility with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In the UK Biobank, in utero tobacco exposure (n = 354,493) and age of smoking initiation (n = 353,557) were self-reported. A composite lifestyle score was calculated based on diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep duration, and BMI. Hazard ratio (HR) and absolute risk difference (ARD) were used to estimate the associations of early-life smoking behaviors and genetic risk with incident T2D, as well as the effect modification of the lifestyle score. During a median follow-up of 14.6 years, the HRs (95 % CIs) of T2D for in utero tobacco exposure, and smoking initiation in adulthood, adolescence, and childhood, compared with no smoking behavior, were 1.19 (1.16-1.23), 1.34 (1.29-1.39), 1.58 (1.53-1.64), 2.22 (2.11-2.32), respectively (P for trend<0.001). Early-life smoking behaviors and high genetic risk (vs no smoking behavior and low genetic risk) were associated with a 302%-593 % higher T2D risk (P for additive interaction<0.05). Compared to participants with early-life smoking behaviors, high genetic risk, and an unfavorable lifestyle, those who adhered to a favorable lifestyle had a lower T2D risk in all subgroups (HRs from 0.05 to 0.36 and ARD from -14.97 % to -9.51 %), with the highest ARD attributable to lifestyle in participants with early-life smoking behaviors and high genetic risk. The T2D risk associated with early-life smoking behaviors and genetic risk was modified by a favorable lifestyle.",pubmed

Type 2 diabetes is one of the most common noncommunicable diseases in the world. Recent studies suggest a link between type 2 diabetes and microbiota, as well as the ability to treat and prevent it using personalized approaches to nutrition. In this work, we conducted clinical studies on the effects of a personalized diet on 56 female patients. Biochemical, physical, and immunological parameters were measured by standard methods on days 1 and 18 of the experiment. Gut and oral microbiota studies were performed in dynamics on days 1, 7, 11, and 18 using real-time polymerase chain reaction. With the help of the developed information system, a personalized diet was developed for each participant of the experiment. In the group of patients following personalized diets a statistically significant decreasing levels of glucose, thymol test, creatinine, very low-density lipoprotein, urea, secretory IgA, and tumour necrosis factor-α, and improvement in all physical parameters were observed. There was a statistically significant increase in uric acid, sodium, and magnesium. Statistically significant changes in gut microbiota were observed in Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli (lac+, lac-), Lactobacillus spp., and Candida spp. Such microorganisms of oral microbiota as E. faecalis, Lactobacillus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida spp. demonstrated statistically significant changes.

The aim of this review is to discuss and evaluate diabetic sarcopenia (DS) and its relationship with nutrition by discussing the mechanisms of diabetic sarcopenia in detail and comprehensively reviewing the literature. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) affects approximately 25% of people aged 50 years and over and indicates a significant the cost of health for the elderly. Nutrition is an important part of these treatment approaches, and in this review, the literature was comprehensively reviewed, focusing on understanding the mechanisms of DS and discussing its relationship with nutrition. A comprehensive search was conducted on Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed from inception up to July 2024. The aim of nutritional treatment for DS is to improve muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance while improving diabetes-related metabolic risk and glucose levels. In this context, it is important to determine energy intake in individuals with DS according to calorie intake exceeding 30 kcal/kg. For these individuals, a protein intake of at least 1-1.2 g/kg/day is recommended, with an emphasis on the number and timing of meals and a nutritional pattern rich in branched chain amino acids (BCAA). In addition, it is important to adopt a diet rich in antioxidants and to choose diet patterns that contain sufficient levels of macro and micronutrients. The Mediterranean diet model can be a good diet option for individuals with DS.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a growing concern worldwide, particularly in Indigenous communities, which have undergone a marked nutrition transition characterized by reduced intakes of traditional foods and increased intakes of market foods. Few studies have assessed the relationships between differing dietary patterns and risk for type 2 diabetes in Indigenous communities in Canada. The objective of the study was to characterize dietary patterns using factor analysis (FA) and to relate these patterns to the incidence of type 2 diabetes after 10 years of follow up in a First Nations community in Ontario, Canada. We conducted a prospective analysis of 492 participants in the SLHDP who did not have diabetes at baseline (1993 to 1995) and were followed for 10 years. A food-frequency questionnaire was administered, and FA was used to identify patterns of food consumption. Multivariate logistic regression analyses determined associations of food patterns with incident type 2 diabetes, adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle confounders. At follow up, 86 participants had developed incident type 2 diabetes. FA revealed 3 prominent dietary patterns: Balanced Market Foods, Beef and Processed Foods and Traditional Foods. After adjustment for age, sex, waist circumference, interleukin-6 and adiponectin, the Beef and Processed Foods pattern was associated with increased risk for incident type 2 diabetes (OR=1.38; 95% CI 1.02, 1.86). In contrast, the Balanced Market Foods and Traditional Foods Patterns were not significantly associated with type 2 diabetes. Dietary interventions should encourage reduced consumption of unhealthful market foods, in combination with improvements in local food environments so as to increase access to healthful foods and reduce food insecurity in Indigenous communities.",pubmed

Deciphering the heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes in prognosis and treatment effect is essential. We used a novel dimensionality reduction approach to describe the type 2 diabetes phenotype continuum and visualize the difference in lifestyle intervention efficacy in Chinese patients. Based on 17,816 participants with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (aged ≥40 years) from a nationwide cohort, 12 key phenotypes were residualized for age and sex to construct a two-dimensional tree structure. The tree demonstrated the continuous type 2 diabetes spectrum and region-specific characteristics, with a mixed phenotypic trunk and three extreme phenotypic branches. When mapping data from 325 participants with type 2 diabetes from a randomized controlled trial onto the original tree, lifestyle intervention induced a migration toward the left part of tree, indicating an overall metabolic improvement. Specifically, diet intervention was more effective for glycemic control in the upper part of the tree and featured moderate diabesity and elevated insulin, whereas exercise intervention was more effective for glycemic control in the left side of the tree and featured less adiposity and better overall metabolic status. In summary, this analysis depicted the tree structure representing the underlying pathophysiological features of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and identified tree regions with different sensitivity to diet or exercise intervention. The results have the potential to aid lifestyle intervention selection. Deciphering the heterogeneity of diabetes is essential for prognosis prediction and treatment guidance, but current classifications are flawed because they lose continuous phenotypic information. We wanted to determine if the novel data reduction method, the data dimensionality reduction tree (DDRTree), is applicable to visualizing the phenotypic continuum, comorbid conditions, and lifestyle intervention effects in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. The DDRTree structure demonstrated the region-specific characteristics of type 2 diabetes. Diet intervention was more effective for glycemic control in the upper part of the tree, featuring moderate diabesity, whereas exercise intervention was more effective in the left side of the tree, featuring less adiposity and better overall metabolic status.

Diabetes is one of the most common metabolic diseases. Aside from the genetic factor, previous studies stated that other factors such as environment, lifestyle, and paternal-maternal condition play critical roles in diabetes through DNA methylation in specific areas of the genome. One of diabetic cases is caused by insulin resistance and changing the homeostasis of blood glucose control so glucose concentration stood beyond normal rate (hyperglycemia). High fat diet has been frequently studied and linked to triggering diabetes. However, most Asians consume rice (or food with high carbohydrate) and food with monosodium glutamate (MSG). This habit could lead to pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Previous studies showed that high-carbohydrate or high-MSG diet could change gene expression or modify protein activity in body metabolism. This imbalanced metabolism can lead to pleiotropic effects of diabetes mellitus. In this study, the authors have attempted to relate various changes in genes expression or protein activity to the high-carbohydrate and high-MSG-induced diabetes. The authors have also tried to relate several genes that contribute to pathophysiology of T2D and proposed several ideas of genes as markers and target for curing people with T2D. These are done by investigating altered activities of various genes that cause or are caused by diabetes. These genes are selected based on their roles in pathophysiology of T2D.",pubmed

The development or remission of diet-induced overweight type 2 diabetes involves many biological changes which occur over very different timescales. Remission, defined by HbA<sub>1c</sub><6.5%, or fasting plasma glucose concentration G<126 mg/dl, may be achieved rapidly by following weight loss guidelines. However, remission is often short-term, followed by relapse. Mathematical modelling provides a way of investigating a typical situation, in which patients are advised to lose weight and then maintain fat mass, a slow variable. Remission followed by relapse, in a modelling sense, is equivalent to changing from a remission trajectory with steady state G<126 mg/dl, to a relapse trajectory with steady state G≥126 mg/dl. Modelling predicts that a trajectory which maintains weight will be a relapse trajectory, if the fat mass chosen is too high, the threshold being dependent on the lipid to carbohydrate ratio of the diet. Modelling takes into account the effects of hepatic and pancreatic lipid on hepatic insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, respectively. This study leads to the suggestion that type 2 diabetes remission guidelines be given in terms of model parameters, not variables; that is, the patient should adhere to a given nutrition and exercise plan, rather than achieve a certain subset of variable values. The model predicts that calorie restriction, not weight loss, initiates remission from type 2 diabetes; and that advice of the form 'adhere to the diet and exercise plan' rather than 'achieve a certain weight loss' may help counter relapse.",pubmed

The Diabetes Telemedicine Mediterranean Diet (DiaTeleMed) Study is a fully remote randomized clinical trial evaluating personalized dietary management in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The study aims to test the efficacy of a personalized behavioral approach for dietary management of moderately controlled T2D, versus a standardized behavioral intervention that uses one-size-fits-all dietary recommendations, versus a usual care control (UCC). The primary outcome will compare the impact of each intervention on the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE). Eligible participants are between 21 and 80 years of age diagnosed with moderately controlled T2D (HbA1c: 6.0 to 8.0%) and managed on lifestyle alone or lifestyle plus metformin. Participants must be willing and able to attend virtual counseling sessions and log meals into a dietary tracking smartphone application (DayTwo), and wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for up to 12 days. Participants are randomized with equal allocation (n = 255, n = 85 per arm) to one of three arms: (1) Personalized, (2) Standardized, or (3) UCC. Measurements occur at 0 (baseline), 3, and 6 months. All participants receive isocaloric energy and macronutrient targets to meet Mediterranean diet guidelines, in addition to 14 intervention contacts over 6 months (4 weekly then 10 biweekly) to cover diabetes self-management education. The first 4 UCC intervention contacts are delivered via synchronous videoconferences followed by educational video links. Participants in Standardized receive the same educational content as those in the UCC arm, following the same schedule. However, all intervention contacts are conducted via synchronous videoconferences, paired with Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)-based behavioral counseling, plus dietary self-monitoring of planned meals using a mobile app that provides real-time feedback on calories and macronutrients.

Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are 12-fold more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) 4-6 years after delivery than women without GDM. Similarly, GDM is associated with the development of common mental disorders (CMDs) (e.g. anxiety and depression). Evidence shows that holistic lifestyle interventions focusing on physical activity (PA), dietary intake, sleep, and mental well-being strategies can prevent T2D and CMDs. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a holistic lifestyle mobile health intervention (mHealth) with post-GDM women in preventing T2D and CMDs in a community setting in Singapore. The study consists of a 1-year randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a 3-year follow-up period. Post-GDM women with no current diabetes diagnosis and not planning to become pregnant will be eligible for the study. In addition, participants will complete mental well-being questionnaires (e.g. depression, anxiety, sleep) and their child's socio-emotional and cognitive development. The participants will be randomised to either Group 1 (Intervention) or Group 2 (comparison). The intervention group will receive the ""LVL UP App"", a smartphone-based, conversational agent-delivered holistic lifestyle intervention focused on three pillars: Move More (PA), Eat Well (Diet), and Stress Less (mental wellbeing). The intervention consists of health literacy and psychoeducational coaching sessions, daily ""Life Hacks"" (healthy activity suggestions), slow-paced breathing exercises, a step tracker (including brisk steps), a low-burden food diary, and a journaling tool. Women from both groups will be provided with an Oura ring for tracking physical activity, sleep, and heart rate variability (a proxy for stress), and the ""HAPPY App"", a mHealth app which provides health promotion information about PA, diet, sleep, and mental wellbeing, as well as display body mass index, blood pressure, and results from the oral glucose tolerance tests. Short-term aggregate effects will be assessed at 26/27 weeks (midpoint) and a 1-year visit, followed by a 2, 3, and 4-year follow-up period. High rates of progression of T2D and CMDs in women with post-GDM suggest an urgent need to promote a healthy lifestyle, including diet, PA, sleep, and mental well-being. Preventive interventions through a holistic, healthy lifestyle may be the solution, considering the inextricable relationship between physical and psychological health.

Only for the subscale of organized exercise were no statistically significant differences found (t = 0.50; <i>p</i> = 0.620). <i>Conclusions</i>: Type 2 diabetes is one of the diseases in which lifestyle not only contributes to its development but is also associated with its course and treatment outcomes. Reinforcing a health-promoting lifestyle is one of the cornerstones of treating patients with type 2 diabetes.",pubmed

The exponentially growing frequency of diagnosing diabetes mellitus means that a verification of the previous dietetic approach to treating the disease seems justified. The simultaneous growth of interest in the ketogenic diet and the development of knowledge in this field have contributed to the increasingly frequent application of the ketogenic diet in diabetes treatment. This paper also deals with that issue; its aim includes an extensive analysis of the influence of the ketogenic diet on the prophylaxis and treatment of diabetes. The paper has been prepared based on a wide, meticulous analysis of the available literature on the subject. Among other findings, a favorable effect of that nutrition model has been demonstrated on the values of glycated hemoglobin, glucose, insulin, or other metabolic parameters in diabetes patients. The effect of the ketogenic diet on the pharmacotherapy of type 1 and type 2 diabetes has been presented and compared with the standard nutritional management plan recommended for that disease. Further research is needed in this field, especially studies with a long follow-up period. The discussed articles report interesting therapeutic advantages to the ketogenic diet in comparison with standard diets.",pubmed

Patients report that adhering to diet is the most challenging aspect of diabetes management. Provision of diet education is often delegated to health care providers, despite a lack of nutrition education and training and limited awareness of environmental and cultural challenges faced by patients. <i>Aim</i>. We examined perceived barriers to diet self-management among low-income minority patients with type 2 diabetes and their health care providers within a single ecosystem, to test whether providers understood patient barriers. <i>Method.</i> We surveyed 149 members of a safety-net clinic (99 patients, 50 providers), using barriers derived from the literature. Binomial logistic regression was applied to investigate relationships between barriers and patients' sociodemographic variables and Pearson's χ<sup>2</sup> was used to compare differences in perceived barriers between patients and providers. <i>Results.</i> Providers expressed divergent perceptions of patients' barriers to healthy eating, including more total barriers and little agreement with patients on their relative importance. Largest differences in providers' perceptions of patient barriers included poor motivation, high use of fast food, inadequate family support, and lack of cooking skills-all suggesting patient inadequacy. In contrast, patients showed evidence of high motivation-in rate of blood glucose measurement and desire for diet education. Patients identified primary care providers as a main source of nutrition education, yet providers indicated lack of time for diet discussion and preferred other staff do the teaching. <i>Conclusion.</i> The findings from this study strongly suggest that health systems need to consider patient, provider, and system barriers when implementing nutrition education and management programs.",pubmed

The management of type 2 diabetes mellitus includes ability and empowerment of the patient to change lifestyle, maintain an adequate diet and physical activity, manage the disease, and follow a specific program of periodic medical checks and education sessions. In addition, the patient should be able to correctly identify and adequately solve problems related to the disease and actively collaborate with the healthcare system. To obtain these goals, therapeutic patient education (TPE) is now considered a crucial element not only in the treatment but also in the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Several trials showed that TPE is able to improve clinical, lifestyle, and psycho-social outcomes. Nevertheless, studies have not clarified the ideal characteristics of a comprehensive patient education program in clinical practice. Other work is needed to answer open questions regarding the type of PTE (individual or group education), themes, frequency and number of education sessions, contact time between educator and patient, background of educators, use of new technologies, and barriers to self-management.

Cost-effectiveness (CE) of lifestyle change programs (LCP) for type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention is influenced by a participant's risk. We identified the risk threshold of developing T2D in the intervention population that was cost-effective for three formats of the LCP: delivered in-person individually or in groups, or delivered virtually. We compared the cost-effectiveness across program formats when there were more than one cost-effective formats. Using the CDC-RTI T2D CE Simulation model, we estimated CEs associated with 3 program formats in 8 population groups with an annual T2D incidence of 1% to 8%. We generated a nationally representative simulation population for each risk level using the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. We used an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in 25-years, to measure the CEs of the programs. We took a health care system perspective. To achieve an ICER of $50,000/QALY or lower, the annual T2D incidence of the program participant needed to be ≥5% for the in-person individual program, ≥4% for the digital individual program, and ≥3% for the in-person group program. For those with T2D risk of ≥4%, the in-person group program always dominated the digital individual program. The in-person individual program was cost-effective compared with the in-person group program only among persons with T2D risk of ≥8%.

Based on a correlational design and random multistage sampling in communities (N = 3243), data were collected through face-to-face interviews and anthropometric measurements. Education, occupation, and income were considered indicators of socioeconomic status. Approximately 7.5% persons interviewed had newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Chi-square analyses showed that higher socioeconomic indicators (higher income, nonmanual occupation) were associated with increased risk. Lifestyle risk factors, including alcohol use, unhealthy diet, and higher body mass index, were significantly positively associated with type 2 diabetes. Adjusting for demographic characteristics, hierarchical logistic regression analyses showed that unhealthy diet and high body mass index were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes. Higher incomes and nonmanual occupations were related to a greater prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and high body mass index mediated these associations.

Some studies have found transportation noise to be associated with higher diabetes risk. This includes studies based on millions of participants, relying entirely on register-based confounder adjustment, which raises concern about residual lifestyle confounding. We aimed to investigate associations between noise and type 2 diabetes (T2D), including investigation of effects of increasing confounder adjustment for register-data and lifestyle. In a cohort of 286,151 participants randomly selected across Denmark in 2010-2013 and followed up until 2017, we identified 7574 incident T2D cases. Based on residential address-history for all participants linked with exposure assessment of high spatial resolution, we calculated 10-year time-weighted mean road and railway noise at the most (LdenMax) and least (LdenMin) exposed façades and air pollution (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). We used Cox models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with increasing adjustment for individual- and area-level register-based sociodemographic covariates, self-reported lifestyle and air pollution. We found that a 10 dB increase in 10-year mean road LdenMin was associated with HRs (95% CI) of 1.06 (1.02-1.10) after adjustment for age, sex and year, 1.08 (1.04-1.13) after further adjustment for register-based sociodemographic covariates, 1.07 (1.03-1.12) after further lifestyle adjustment (e.g. smoking, diet and alcohol) and 1.06 (1.02-1.11) after further PM<sub>2.5</sub> adjustment. For road LdenMax, the corresponding HRs were 1.07 (1.04-1.10), 1.05 (1.02-1.08), 1.04 (1.01-1.07) and 1.03 (1.00-1.06).

Over the last several decades, there has been a considerable growth in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in Asians. A pathophysiological mechanism in Asian T2DM is closely linked to low insulin secretion, β-cell mass, and inability to compensate for insulin resistance. We hypothesized that genetic variants associated with lower β-cell mass and function and their combination with unhealthy lifestyle factors significantly raise T2DM risk among Asians. This hypothesis was explored with participants aged over 40. Participants were categorized into T2DM (case; n = 5383) and control (n = 53,318) groups. The genetic variants associated with a higher risk of T2DM were selected from a genome-wide association study in a city hospital-based cohort, and they were confirmed with a replicate study in Ansan/Ansung plus rural cohorts. The interacted genetic variants were identified with generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis, and the polygenic risk score (PRS)-nutrient interactions were examined. The 8-SNP model was positively associated with T2DM risk by about 10 times, exhibiting a higher association than the 20-SNP model, including all T2DM-linked SNPs with p < 5 × 10−6. The SNPs in the models were primarily involved in pancreatic β-cell growth and survival. The PRS of the 8-SNP model interacted with three lifestyle factors: energy intake based on the estimated energy requirement (EER), Western-style diet (WSD), and smoking status. Fasting serum glucose concentrations were much higher in the participants with High-PRS in rather low EER intake and high-WSD compared to the High-EER and Low-WSD, respectively. They were shown to be higher in the participants with High-PRS in smokers than in non-smokers. In conclusion, the genetic impact of T2DM risk was mainly involved with regulating pancreatic β-cell mass and function, and the PRS interacted with lifestyles. These results highlight the interaction between genetic impacts and lifestyles in precision nutrition.",pubmed

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become a major public health concern, causing significant disability and death worldwide. Fuelled by a modern sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary practices, T2DM affects at least 10.5% of the world's population. This paper seeks to review the progress made by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) in addressing T2DM, focusing on glycaemic control proportions and comparing it with the 2015 review. The results indicate no significant improvement in glycaemic control proportions since the last review, with only 9.2% to 56.9% of patients having good control (glycosylated haemoglobin < 7%). However, there are no significant differences in glycaemic control between the GCC countries and other places worldwide despite being considered hotbeds of T2DM. Many factors contribute to poor glycaemic control. Specifically, evidence shows that being overweight or obese is the most common modifiable risk factor for T2DM incidence and poor glycaemic control. The GCC countries have higher rates of obesity. Additionally, poor glycaemic control is mainly related to a lack of adherence to insulin and medication use. Poor diet, rich in calories and low in fruits and vegetables, and a sedentary lifestyle also significantly contribute to poor glycaemic control and obesity. Therefore, to reduce the incidence of disease and improve glycaemic control in diabetic patients, educational programs promoting lifestyle changes should be implemented. Ongoing research is also necessary to assess the trend of glycaemic control and its risk factors in our region.",pubmed

respiratory_27189863,27189863,respiratory,2015.0,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease with high global morbidity and mortality. COPD is characterized by poorly reversible airway obstruction, which is confirmed by spirometry, and includes obstruction of the small airways (chronic obstructive bronchiolitis) and emphysema, which lead to air trapping and shortness of breath in response to physical exertion. The most common risk factor for the development of COPD is cigarette smoking, but other environmental factors, such as exposure to indoor air pollutants - especially in developing countries - might influence COPD risk. Not all smokers develop COPD and the reasons for disease susceptibility in these individuals have not been fully elucidated. Although the mechanisms underlying COPD remain poorly understood, the disease is associated with chronic inflammation that is usually corticosteroid resistant. In addition, COPD involves accelerated ageing of the lungs and an abnormal repair mechanism that might be driven by oxidative stress. Acute exacerbations, which are mainly triggered by viral or bacterial infections, are important as they are linked to a poor prognosis. The mainstay of the management of stable disease is the use of inhaled long-acting bronchodilators, whereas corticosteroids are beneficial primarily in patients who have coexisting features of asthma, such as eosinophilic inflammation and more reversibility of airway obstruction. Apart from smoking cessation, no treatments reduce disease progression. More research is needed to better understand disease mechanisms and to develop new treatments that reduce disease activity and progression.",pubmed

Evidence for a potential role of diet and nutrition as a risk factor in the development of COPD has been accumulating and is reflected in the dietary patterns of patients with COPD. Consuming a healthy diet should, therefore, be promoted in patients with COPD. Distinct COPD phenotypes have been identified incorporating nutritional status, ranging from cachexia and frailty to obesity. The importance of body composition assessment and the need for tailored nutritional screening instruments is further highlighted. Dietary interventions and targeted single or multi-nutrient supplementation can be beneficial when optimal timing is considered.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease with high incidence rate and mortality rates worldwide. It is the third leading cause of death in the world.

Although patients with early COPD have no symptoms, their lung function is already lower than that of normal people. A relatively complete definition is needed to identify this group of people. Reduced lung function is the diagnostic criterion for COPD, but lung development is a long-term dynamic process. In addition to smoking and air pollution, we should pay more attention to prenatal and childhood risk factors, for example, parents smoking, birth weight, preterm birth, mode of delivery, childhood respiratory infections and childhood asthma.

Tobacco exposure and biomass fuel/solid fuel usage were documented as two important risk factors of COPD. COPD ranked among the top three leading causes of death in China. The direct medical cost of COPD ranged from 72 to 3,565 USD per capita per year, accounting for 33.33% to 118.09% of local average annual income. The most commonly used scales for the assessment of quality of life (QoL) included Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire, Airways Questionnaire 20, SF-36, and their revised versions. The status of QoL was worse among COPD patients than in non-COPD patients, and COPD patients were at higher risks of depression. The COPD burden in China was high in terms of economic burden and QoL. In view of the high smoking rate and considerable concerns related to air pollution and smog in China, countermeasures need to be taken to improve disease prevention and management to reduce disease burdens raised by COPD.",pubmed

Data promoting a more targeted approach to inhaled and systemic corticosteroid use in COPD are reviewed. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, including the recently approved PDE 3/4 inhibitor inhaled ensifentrine, are noted. Selective use of antibiotics can play a role in complex COPD patients. COPD patients with evidence of asthma-COPD overlap syndrome and type-two lymphocytic inflammatory-mediated airway constriction appear to respond to biologics, particularly the anti-IL-4/IL-3 antagonist monoclonal antibody, dupilumab.

Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the United States; however, an estimated one fourth of adults with COPD have never smoked (1). CDC analyzed state-specific Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 2017, which indicated that, overall among U.S. adults, 6.2% (age-adjusted) reported having been told by a health care professional that they had COPD. The age-adjusted prevalence of COPD was 15.2% among current cigarette smokers, 7.6% among former smokers, and 2.8% among adults who had never smoked. Higher prevalences of COPD were observed in southeastern and Appalachian states, regardless of smoking status of respondents. Whereas the strong positive correlation between state prevalence of COPD and state prevalence of current smoking was expected among current and former smokers, a similar relationship among adults who had never smoked suggests secondhand smoke exposure as a potential risk factor for COPD. Continued promotion of smoke-free environments might reduce COPD among both those who smoke and those who do not.",pubmed

Global distributions and trends of the risk-attributable burdens of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have rarely been systematically explored. To guide the formulation of targeted and accurate strategies for the management of COPD, we analyzed COPD burdens attributable to known risk factors. Using detailed COPD data from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019, we analyzed disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and deaths attributable to each risk factor from 1990 to 2019. Additionally, we calculated estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) during the study period. The population attributable fraction (PAF) and summary exposure value (SEV) of each risk factor are also presented. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized DALY and death rates of COPD attributable to smoking and household air pollution, occupational particles, secondhand smoke, and low temperature presented consistently declining trends in almost all socio-demographic index (SDI) regions. However, the decline in YLD was not as dramatic as that of the death rate. In contrast, the COPD burden attributable to ambient particulate matter, ozone, and high temperature exposure showed undesirable increasing trends in the low- and low-middle-SDI regions. In addition, the age-standardized DALY and death rates attributable to each risk factor except household air pollution and low temperature were the highest in the low-middle-SDI region. In 2019, the COPD burden attributable to smoking ambient particulate matter, ozone, occupational particles, low and high temperature was obviously greater in males than in females. Meanwhile, the most important risk factors for female varied across regions (low- and low-middle-SDI regions: household air pollution; middle-SDI region: ambient particles; high-middle- and high-SDI region: smoking). Increasing trends of COPD burden attributable to ambient particulate matter, ozone, and high temperature exposure in the low-middle- and low-SDI regions call for an urgent need to implement specific and effective measures. Moreover, considering the gender differences in COPD burdens attributable to some risk factors such as ambient particulate matter and ozone with similar SEV, further research on biological differences between sexes in COPD and relevant policy-making of disease prevention are required.",pubmed

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects the health of more than 300 million people worldwide; at present, there is no effective drug to treat COPD. Smoking is the most important risk factor, but the molecular mechanism by which smoking causes the disease is unclear. The senescence of lung epithelial cells is related to development of COPD. Regulation of miRNAs is the main epigenetic mechanism related to aging. β-Galactose staining showed that the lung tissues of smokers have a higher degree of cellular senescence, and the expression of miR-125a-5p is high. This effect is obvious for smokers with COPD/emphysema, and there is a negative correlation between miR-125a-5p levels and values for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC). After Balb/c mice were chronically exposed to various concentrations of cigarette smoke (CS), plethysmography showed that lung function was impaired, lung tissue senescence was increased, and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was increased. For mouse lung epithelial (MLE)-12 cells treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE), Sp1 and SIRT1 levels were low, HIF-1α acetylation levels were high, and cell senescence and secretion of SASP factors were elevated. Down-regulation of miR-125a-5p or up-regulation of Sp1 reversed these effects. In addition, compared with mice exposed to CS, knockdown of miR-125a-5p reduced lung epithelial cell senescence and COPD/emphysema. Therefore, in smoking-induced COPD, elevated miR-125a-5p participates in the senescence of lung epithelial cells through Sp1/SIRT1/HIF-1α. These findings provide evidence related to the pathogenesis of COPD/emphysema caused by chronic smoking.",pubmed

By performing an array of advanced bioinformatic analyses, such as gene set enrichment analysis, trajectory analysis, cell-cell interactions analysis, regulatory potential analysis, weighted correlation network analysis, functional interaction analysis, and gene set variation analysis, we integrated cell-type-level alterations into a system-level malfunction and provided a more clarified COPD pathological model containing specific mechanisms by which aging and smoking facilitate COPD development. Finally, we integrated the publicly available scRNA-seq data of 9 individuals, resulting in a total of 110,931 cells, and replicated the analyses to enhance the credibility of our findings. Our study pointed to enrichment of COPD molecular alteration in monocytes, which further induced a previously unrecognized pro-inflammatory effect on alveolar epithelial cells. In addition, aged monocytes and club cells facilitated COPD development via maintaining an autoimmune airway niche. Unexpectedly, macrophages, whose defect to resolve inflammation was long-recognized in COPD pathogenesis, primarily induced an imbalance of sphingolipids rheostat in a smoking-dependent way.

A recent clinical trial using an anti-IL-33 antibody showed a reduction in exacerbation and improved lung function in ex-smokers but not current smokers with COPD. <b>Objectives:</b> This study aimed to understand the effects of smoking status on IL-33. <b>Methods:</b> We investigated the association of smoking status with the level of gene expression of <i>IL-33</i> in the airways in eight independent transcriptomic studies of lung airways. Additionally, we performed Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry for IL-33 in lung tissue to assess protein levels. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Across the bulk RNA-sequencing datasets, <i>IL-33</i> gene expression and its signaling pathway were significantly lower in current versus former or never-smokers and increased upon smoking cessation (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Single-cell sequencing showed that <i>IL-33</i> is predominantly expressed in resting basal epithelial cells and decreases during the differentiation process triggered by smoke exposure. We also found a higher transitioning of this cellular subpopulation into a more differentiated cell type during chronic smoking, potentially driving the reduction of <i>IL-33</i>. Protein analysis demonstrated lower IL-33 levels in lung tissue from current versus former smokers with COPD and a lower proportion of IL-33-positive basal cells in current versus ex-smoking controls. <b>Conclusions:</b> We provide strong evidence that cigarette smoke leads to an overall reduction in IL-33 expression in transcriptomic and protein level, and this may be due to the decrease in resting basal cells. Together, these findings may explain the clinical observation that a recent antibody-based anti-IL-33 treatment is more effective in former than current smokers with COPD.",pubmed
respiratory_33325455,33325455,respiratory,2020.0,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - diagnosis and management of stable disease; a personalized approach to care, using the treatable traits concept based on clinical phenotypes. Position paper of the Czech Pneumological and Phthisiological Society.. This position paper has been drafted by experts from the Czech national board of diseases with bronchial obstruction, of the Czech Pneumological and Phthisiological Society. The statements and recommendations are based on both the results of randomized controlled trials and data from cross-sectional and prospective real-life studies to ensure they are as close as possible to the context of daily clinical practice and the current health care system of the Czech Republic. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable heterogeneous syndrome with a number of pulmonary and extrapulmonary clinical features and concomitant chronic diseases. The disease is associated with significant mortality, morbidity and reduced quality of life. The main characteristics include persistent respiratory symptoms and only partially reversible airflow obstruction developing due to an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles and gases. Oxidative stress, protease-antiprotease imbalance and increased numbers of pro-inflammatory cells (mainly neutrophils) are the main drivers of primarily non-infectious inflammation in COPD. Besides smoking, household air pollution, occupational exposure, low birth weight, frequent respiratory infections during childhood and also genetic factors are important risk factors of COPD development. Progressive airflow limitation and airway remodelling leads to air trapping, static and dynamic hyperinflation, gas exchange abnormalities and decreased exercise capacity. Various features of the disease are expressed unequally in individual patients, resulting in various types of disease presentation, emerging as the ""clinical phenotypes"" (for specific clinical characteristics) and ""treatable traits"" (for treatable characteristics) concept. The estimated prevalence of COPD in Czechia is around 6.7% with 3,200-3,500 deaths reported annually. The elementary requirements for diagnosis of COPD are spirometric confirmation of post-bronchodilator airflow obstruction (post-BD FEV<sub>1</sub>/VCmax <70%) and respiratory symptoms assessement (dyspnoea, exercise limitation, cough and/or sputum production. In order to establish definite COPD diagnosis, a five-step evaluation should be performed, including: 1/ inhalation risk assessment, 2/ symptoms evaluation, 3/ lung function tests, 4/ laboratory tests and 5/ imaging. At the same time, all alternative diagnoses should be excluded. For disease classification, this position paper uses both GOLD stages (1 to 4), GOLD groups (A to D) and evaluation of clinical phenotype(s). Prognosis assessment should be done in each patient. For this purpose, we recommend the use of the BODE or the CADOT index. Six elementary clinical phenotypes are recognized, including chronic bronchitis, frequent exacerbator, emphysematous, asthma/COPD overlap (ACO), bronchiectases with COPD overlap (BCO) and pulmonary cachexia. In our concept, all of these clinical phenotypes are also considered independent treatable traits. For each treatable trait, specific pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies are defined in this document. The coincidence of two or more clinical phenotypes (i.e., treatable traits) may occur in a single individual, giving the opportunity of fully individualized, phenotype-specific treatment. Treatment of COPD should reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease and be tailored to individual patients. Major goals of COPD treatment are symptom reduction and decreased exacerbation risk. Treatment strategy is divided into five strata: risk elimination, basic treatment, phenotype-specific treatment, treatment of respiratory failure and palliative care, and treatment of comorbidities. Risk elimination includes interventions against tobacco smoking and environmental/occupational exposures. Basic treatment is based on bronchodilator therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, vaccination, care for appropriate nutrition, inhalation training, education and psychosocial support. Adequate phenotype-specific treatment varies phenotype by phenotype, including more than ten different pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies. If more than one clinical phenotype is present, treatment strategy should follow the expression of each phenotypic label separately. In such patients, multicomponental therapeutic regimens are needed, resulting in fully individualized care. In the future, stronger measures against smoking, improvements in occupational and environmental health, early diagnosis strategies, as well as biomarker identification for patients responsive to specific treatments are warranted. New classes of treatment (inhaled PDE3/4 inhibitors, single molecule dual bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory drugs, gene editing molecules or new bronchoscopic procedures) are expected to enter the clinical practice in a very few years.",pubmed

Lifetime lung function is related to quality of life and longevity. Over the lifespan, individuals follow different lung function trajectories. Identification of these trajectories, their determinants, and outcomes is important, but no study has done this beyond the fourth decade. We used six waves of the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS) to model lung function trajectories measured at 7, 13, 18, 45, 50, and 53 years. We analysed pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> z-scores at the six timepoints using group-based trajectory modelling to identify distinct subgroups of individuals whose measurements followed a similar pattern over time. We related the trajectories identified to childhood factors and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using logistic regression, and estimated population-attributable fractions of COPD. Of the 8583 participants in the original cohort, 2438 had at least two waves of lung function data at age 7 years and 53 years and comprised the study population. We identified six trajectories: early below average, accelerated decline (97 [4%] participants); persistently low (136 [6%] participants); early low, accelerated growth, normal decline (196 [8%] participants); persistently high (293 [12%] participants); below average (772 [32%] participants); and average (944 [39%] participants). The three trajectories early below average, accelerated decline; persistently low; and below average had increased risk of COPD at age 53 years compared with the average group (early below average, accelerated decline: odds ratio 35·0, 95% CI 19·5-64·0; persistently low: 9·5, 4·5-20·6; and below average: 3·7, 1·9-6·9). Early-life predictors of the three trajectories included childhood asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, allergic rhinitis, eczema, parental asthma, and maternal smoking. Personal smoking and active adult asthma increased the impact of maternal smoking and childhood asthma, respectively, on the early below average, accelerated decline trajectory. We identified six potential FEV<sub>1</sub> trajectories, two of which were novel. Three trajectories contributed 75% of COPD burden and were associated with modifiable early-life exposures whose impact was aggravated by adult factors. We postulate that reducing maternal smoking, encouraging immunisation, and avoiding personal smoking, especially in those with smoking parents or low childhood lung function, might minimise COPD risk. Clinicians and patients with asthma should be made aware of the potential long-term implications of non-optimal asthma control for lung function trajectory throughout life, and the role and benefit of optimal asthma control on improving lung function should be investigated in future intervention trials.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) remains a significant global public health challenge, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study aims to analyze global trends in COPD from 1990 to 2021, with a focus on age, sex, and regional variations. By assessing the global burden of COPD and its association with key risk factors, this research provides critical insights into progress toward health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and underscores the urgent need to prioritize COPD in public health agendas. Utilizing data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, this research conducted a comprehensive ecological analysis of COPD epidemiology from 1990 to 2021. Key measures included incidence, mortality, and age-standardized rates, alongside an examination of risk factors such as smoking and ambient particulate matter pollution, quantified using country-level summary exposure values (SEV). Statistical analyses, including descriptive analysis, annual rate of change (ARC), and correlation analysis, were applied to assess the burden of COPD and investigate its ecological associations with major risk factors. In 2021, COPD accounted for 16.90 million new cases and 3.70 million deaths globally. The age-standardized incidence rate was 197.37 (95% UI: 181.6-213.42) per 100,000 person-years, while the age-standardized mortality rate was 45.22 (95% UI: 40.61-49.70) per 100,000 person-years. Although global COPD incidence rates declined by 2% from 1990 to 2021, the pace and extent of this decline varied, with some age groups, sexes, and regions experiencing slower reductions or even increases. Higher COPD burden was observed in areas with elevated smoking prevalence, air pollution and greater socioeconomic development. This study highlights the ongoing global burden of COPD and its varying trends from 1990 to 2021 across age groups, sexes, and regions. While incidence and mortality rates have slightly declined, disparities persist, particularly among older adults, men, and regions with higher smoking prevalence and air pollution. These findings emphasize the urgent need to integrate COPD into public health priorities, focusing on targeted interventions to reduce key risk factors.

We analysed the characteristics of COPD and coexisting asthma and COPD patients included in the prospective multicentre, French COhort of BRonchial obstruction and Asthma, between 2008 and 2023 and evaluated the number of patients who could correspond to the inclusion criteria of randomised controlled trials evaluating various biologics targeting interleukin 33 (IL-33) (-receptor), IL-5 (-receptor), IL-4Rα or TSLP, in routine clinical practice. Among 434 COPD patients, only 21.7% met inclusion criteria for at least one biologic. Among patients with asthma, 54 (3.5%) had coexisting features of COPD in terms of age, smoking status and airflow obstruction and met inclusion criteria for at least one biologic. Notably, these patients were predominantly female, with worse lung function. Globally, the target chronic airway diseases population of the eagerly awaited biologics remains limited to a small part (ie, 1.3%-8%, depending on the biologic). In a real-life COPD and asthma population (including asthmatic patients with features of COPD), the proportion of patients satisfying selection criteria applied in randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy of biologics remains limited to less than 10% of the whole population.",pubmed

Young chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refers to people with COPD between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Current epidemiological studies focus on local geography, and there is a lack of global-level analysis. This study provides in-depth analyses of the disease burden of young COPD at global, regional, and national levels. This study used the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD). The age-standardised prevalence rate (ASPR), age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardised death rate (ASDR), and age-standardised disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate were used to describe the disease burden. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) during the study period was calculated. Joinpoint regression analysis examined the time trend from 1990 to 2021. Annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) were calculated. Risk factors were reported by region and sex. In 2021, the global number of young COPD cases was 30,384,539, and the ASPR, ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardised DALYs rates fell slightly. Oceania reported the highest ASPR, ASDR, and age-standardised DALYs rate. High-income North America has the highest ASIR. In 2021, the prevalence, incidence, death, and DALYs rates exhibited similar trends, increasing with age. From 1990 to 2021, both the prevalence and death rates showed a consistent downward trend across all age groups. Joinpoint regression analysis indicated a slight increase in both the ASPR (APC: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.19) and the ASIR (APC: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.24) during the period from 1990 to 1994. The leading DALYs attributable to risk factors for young COPD are household air pollution from solid fuels (20.4%), ambient particulate matter pollution (17.9%), and smoking (13.5%). The global burden of ASPR, ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardised DALYs rates in young COPD has decreased, however, the absolute number of patients has increased. The global burden shows noticeable regional differences, with particularly high burdens observed in Oceania. Improving air quality, promoting smoking cessation, and increasing access to lung function tests, raising awareness of young COPD are key strategies for alleviating the burden of young COPD.",pubmed

A total of 414,644 UK Biobank participants were included in the analyses. PA was self-reported and objectively measured using accelerometers. PA was self-reported with IPAQ and objectively measured using accelerometers. Annual PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO air pollutant concentrations in 2010 were measured using a European land use regression model. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the associations of PA and air pollution with health outcomes. Multiplicative and additive interactions were estimated.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characterized by chronic airways inflammation and progressive airflow limitation, is a common, preventable and treatable disease. Worldwide, COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality; smoking tobacco is the most important risk factor. This translational review of recent updates in COPD care for the primary care audience, includes recommendations from the 2015 Global Initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) report on diagnosis, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment, prevalence of comorbidities, management of exacerbations and the asthma and COPD overlap syndrome, with a focus on the importance and benefit of physical activity and exercise in COPD patients. Exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to the overall severity of COPD in individual patients. Management of exacerbations includes reducing the impact of the current exacerbation and preventing development of subsequent episodes. Healthcare professionals need to be alert to comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, anxiety/depression, lung cancer, infections and diabetes, which are common in COPD patients and can have a significant impact on HRQoL and prognosis. Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended by a number of guidelines for all symptomatic COPD patients, regardless of severity, and involves exercise training, patient education, nutritional advice and psychosocial support. At all stages of COPD, regular physical activity and exercise can aid symptom control, improve HRQoL, reduce rates of hospitalization, and improve morbidity and respiratory mortality. Healthcare professionals play a pivotal role in improving HRQoL and health-related outcomes in COPD patients to meet their specific needs and in providing appropriate diagnosis, management and advice on smoking cessation.",pubmed

Approximately 3 billion people around the world cook and heat their homes using solid fuels in open fires and rudimentary stoves, resulting in household air pollution. Household air pollution secondary to indoor combustion of solid fuel is associated with multiple chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes. The exposure is associated with both chronic bronchitis and emphysema phenotypes of COPD as well as a distinct form of obstructive airway disease called bronchial anthracofibrosis. COPD from household air pollution differs from COPD from tobacco smoke with respect to its disproportionately greater bronchial involvement, lesser emphysematous change, greater impact on quality of life, and possibly greater oxygen desaturation and pulmonary hypertensive changes. Interventions that decrease exposure to biomass smoke may decrease the risk for incident COPD and attenuate the longitudinal decline in lung function, but more data on exposure-response relationships from well-designed longitudinal studies are needed.",pubmed

Studies on lung function and respiratory mortality were also considered. Fifteen studies, including seven cohort, six cross-sectional, one case control and one randomized control trial were found. Coffee consumption was generally associated with a reduction in prevalence of asthma. The association of coffee with natural honey was an effective treatment for persistent post-infectious cough. One case-control study found higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with coffee consumption. No association was found with the evolution of COPD or sarcoidosis. Coffee was associated with a reduction in respiratory mortality, and one study found improved lung function in coffee consumers. Smoking was a significant confounder in most studies.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, progressive and preventable non-communicable respiratory disorder. It is often confused with asthma and poorly understood by many lay people. The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoking, but in the South African (SA) context, biomass fuel exposure/household pollution, tuberculosis, HIV and mining exposure are additional important causes.There is a very high prevalence of COPD in SA and it is the third leading cause of mortality globally.The diagnosis of COPD is based predominantly on symptoms, i.e. progressive shortness of breath and cough in a patient with risk factors–usually smoking. Lung function testing is required to formally make the diagnosis, which places a significant hurdle in correctly identifying COPD in SA, given the limited access to spirometry in many areas. Spirometry is also required to grade the severity of lung function obstruction.Severity assessment, which is used to plan a management strategy (predominantly bronchodilators with inhaled steroids in severe cases), combines symptoms, lung function and exacerbations. Based on these 3 factors, a patient can be categorised into 1 of 4 groups and appropriate management instituted. Additional comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular and mental illness, should also be evaluated.Early identification of COPD, with further avoidance of an aetiological cause such as smoking, is key in preventing disease progression.Appropriate therapy, comprising non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions and based on a comprehensive severity assessment, should result in symptom improvement and reduced risk for exacerbations.",pubmed

Smoking cessation is the most important intervention in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and asthma-COPD overlap (ACO); however, high rates of current cigarette smoking are observed in adults with these respiratory diseases. Meanwhile, rapidly increasing use of heated tobacco products (HTPs) is observed in Japan; however, the status of HTPs use has not been fully understood in adults with COPD, asthma, and ACO. This study aimed to reveal the association between COPD, asthma, and ACO and HTPs use in adults. Data on Japanese individuals ≥ 40 years old obtained from the Japan Society and New Tobacco Internet Survey were analyzed. The prevalence of HTPs use in adults with COPD, asthma, and ACO, among individuals categorized into three groups according to cigarette smoking (never, former, and current), was calculated and the relationship between each disease and HTPs use were evaluated. The clinical diagnosis of these diseases was based on the self-reported diagnosis, as obtained from questionnaires. A total of 19,308 individuals were included. The proportions of never, past, and current cigarettes smokers were 10,900 (56.5%), 4,903 (25.4%), and 3,505 (18.2%), respectively, and that of HTPs use was 1,813 (9.4%). In current cigarettes smokers, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of HTPs use was 2.88 (95% CI [confidence interval], 1.86-4.47), 1.23 (95% CI, 0.99-1.52), and 5.81 (95% CI, 3.12-10.82) in adults with COPD, asthma, and ACO compared to those without these respiratory diseases, respectively.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently coexists with various diseases, yet the causal relationship between COPD and these comorbidities remains ambiguous. As a result, the aim of our study is to elucidate the potential causality between COPD and its common comorbidities. We employed the Mendelian randomization (MR) method to analyze single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of common comorbidities with COPD from FinnGen and Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) databases. Causality was primarily assessed using the inverse variance weighting (IVW) method. Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analysis was also conducted to eliminate the interference of smoking-related phenotypes. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure the reliability of our findings. Preliminary univariable MR revealed an increased risk of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (IVW: OR = 1.757, 95% CI = 1.162-2.657, P = 0.008), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (IVW: OR = 1.193, 95% CI = 1.072-1.326, P < 0.001), chronic periodontitis (IVW: OR = 1.213, 95% CI = 1.038-1.417, P = 0.012), and heart failure (HF) (IVW: OR = 1.127, 95% CI = 1.043-1.218, P = 0.002). Additionally, the reverse MR analysis indicated that genetic susceptibility to HF (IVW: OR = 1.272, 95% CI = 1.084-1.493, P = 0.003), obesity (IVW: OR = 1.128, 95% CI = 1.056-1.205, P < 0.001), depression (IVW: OR = 1.491, 95% CI = 1.257-1.770, P < 0.001), and sleep apnea syndrome (IVW: OR = 1.209, 95% CI = 1.087-1.345, P < 0.001) could raise the risk of COPD. The MVMR analysis showed no causal effect of COPD on susceptibility to chronic periodontitis after adjusting for smoking. Our study identified that COPD may elevate the risk of LUSC, HF, and CKD. Additionally, our analysis revealed that HF, sleep apnea symptoms, depression, and obesity might also increase the susceptibility to COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is commonly attributed to smoking, and other potential risk factors are ignored. We aimed to critically appraise the epidemiological credibility of the risk factors for COPD that have been examined in published meta-analyses. We performed a systematic search to capture systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies on environmental factors and biomarkers for risk of COPD. We applied a set of standardised methodological criteria based on the level of statistical significance, sample size, between-study heterogeneity and statistical biases. Our search yielded 11 eligible papers, including 18 meta-analyses on environmental factors or biomarkers for COPD risk, and eight eligible papers with systematic reviews only. Eleven associations achieved statistical significance at <i>P</i> < 0.001 and six associations at <i>P</i> < 1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>. Thirteen associations presented an <i>I</i>²  50%, while six associations had evidence of small-study effects and/or excess significance bias. History of tuberculosis or rheumatoid arthritis, exposure to biomass fuels, tobacco smoking and second hand smoking were supported by high epidemiological credibility for an increased risk of COPD. Furthermore, highly suggestive evidence was found for increased levels of serum C-reactive protein, and serum fibrinogen in COPD patients compared with healthy controls. To summarise, our approach suggests that, while a proportion of COPD patients are non-smokers, only a narrow range of risk factors not related to smoking have been studied for an association with COPD. There is also a need to decipher possible protective factors in COPD pathogenesis given that more than a half of ever-smokers do not develop COPD.",pubmed

Pandemic-era associations between air pollutant exposures and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are under-explored. Given the considerable observed pandemic-era pollutant fluctuations, these associations were investigated along with possible individual-level risk factors. Participants with spirometry-confirmed COPD from Canadian Cohort Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) were included, with data collected before (""pre-pandemic"") and during (""pandemic"") the COVID-19 pandemic. Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), total oxidant (O<sub>x</sub>) and weather data were obtained from national databases. Associations between each air pollutant and ""symptom-based"" exacerbations (increased dyspnea or sputum volume/purulence ≥48hrs) and ""event-based"" exacerbations (""symptom-based"" plus requiring antibiotics, corticosteroids, or unscheduled healthcare use) were estimated in separate models. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were reported as rate ratios (RRs) per interquartile range (IQR) increment in pollutant concentration with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and O<sub>x</sub> (NO<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations (but not O<sub>3</sub>) fell significantly during the pandemic. In the 673 participants with COPD included, both symptom-based and event-based exacerbation rates were likewise significantly higher during the pre-pandemic period. During the pre-pandemic period, O<sub>x</sub> was positively associated with symptom-based exacerbations (RR: 1.21 [1.08,1.36]). During the pandemic period, O<sub>x</sub> was positively associated with symptom-based (1.46 [1.13,1.89]) and event-based (1.43 [1.00,2.05]) exacerbations. Fewer self-reported pandemic protective behaviors, and higher viral infectious symptoms, were also associated with exacerbations.

Emphysema is a distinct feature for classifying COPD, and smoking history (≥10 pack-years) is one of several newly proposed criteria for asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). We studied whether or not a smoking history (≥10 pack-years) and emphysema are useful markers for classifying ACO and differentiating it from asthma with chronic airflow obstruction (CAO). We retrospectively studied the mortalities and frequencies of exacerbation in 256 consecutive patients with ACO (161 with emphysema and 95 without emphysema) who had ≥10 pack-years smoking history, 64 asthma patients with CAO but less of a smoking history (<10 pack-years) and 537 consecutive patients with COPD (452 with emphysema and 85 without emphysema) from 2000 to 2016. In the patients with emergent admission, the causes were classified into COPD exacerbation, asthma attack, and others. No asthma patients with CAO had emphysema according to computed tomography findings. The prognoses were significantly better in patients with asthma and CAO than in those with ACO and COPD and better in those with ACO than in those with COPD. In both ACO and COPD patients, the prognoses were better in patients without emphysema than in those with it (<i>P</i>=0.027 and <i>P</i>=0.023, respectively). The frequencies of emergent admission were higher in COPD patients than in ACO patients, and higher in patients with emphysema than in patients without emphysema. ACO/emphysema (+) patients experienced more frequent admission due to COPD exacerbation (<i>P</i><0.001), while ACO/emphysema (-) patients experienced more frequent admission due to asthma attack (<i>P</i>=0.014). A smoking history (≥10 pack-years) was found to be a useful marker for differentiating ACO and asthma with CAO, and emphysema was a useful marker for classifying ACO.

The etiology of COPD correlates with complex interactions between environmental and genetic determinants. However, the exact pathogenesis of COPD is obscure although it involves multiple aspects including oxidative stress, imbalance between proteolytic and anti-proteolytic activity, immunity and inflammation, apoptosis, and repair and destruction in both airways and lungs. Many genes have been demonstrated to be involved in those pathogenic processes of this disease in patients exposed to harmful environmental factors. Previous reports have investigated promising microRNAs (miRNAs) to disclose the molecular mechanisms for COPD development induced by different environmental exposure and genetic predisposition encounter, and find some potential miRNA biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment targets of COPD. In this review, we summarized the expression profiles of the reported miRNAs from studies of COPD associated with environmental risk factors including cigarette smoking and air pollution exposures, and provided an overview of roles of those miRNAs in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are well-characterized diseases, they can coexist in a given patient. The term asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) was introduced to describe patients that have clinical features of both diseases and may represent around 25% of COPD patients and around 20% of asthma patients. Despite the increasing interest in ACO, there are still substantial controversies regarding its definition and its position within clinical guidelines for patients with obstructive lung disease. In general, most definitions indicate that ACO patients must present with non-reversible airflow limitation, significant exposure to smoking or other noxious particles or gases, together with features of asthma. In patients with a primary diagnosis of COPD, the identification of ACO has therapeutic implication because the asthmatic component should be treated with inhaled corticosteroids and some studies suggest that the most severe patients may respond to biological agents indicated for severe asthma. This manuscript aims to summarize the current state-of-the-art of ACO. The definitions, prevalence, and clinical manifestations will be reviewed and some innovative aspects, such as genetics, epigenetics, and biomarkers will be addressed.

Using spirometric case definitions, we examined that association in the largest WTC occupational surveillance cohort. We examined the relation between early arrival at the 2001 WTC disaster site (when dust and fumes exposures were most intense) and COPD and ACO in workers with at least one good quality spirometry with bronchodilator response testing between 2002 and 2019, and no physician-diagnosed COPD before 9/11/2001. COPD was defined spirometrically as fixed airflow obstruction and ACO as airflow obstruction plus an increase of ≥ 400 ml in FEV<sub>1</sub> after bronchodilator administration. We used a nested 1:4 case-control design matching on age, sex and height using incidence density sampling. Of the 17,928 study participants, most were male (85.3%) and overweight or obese (84.9%). Further, 504 (2.8%) and 244 (1.4%) study participants met the COPD and ACO spirometric case definitions, respectively. In multivariable analyses adjusted for smoking, occupation, cohort entry period, high peripheral blood eosinophil count and other covariates, early arrival at the WTC site was associated with both COPD (adjusted odds ratio [OR<sub>adj</sub>] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.78) and ACO (OR<sub>adj</sub> = 1.55, 95%CI 1.04-2.32).

This study aimed to investigate the effect of smoking on cognitive function like attention in COPD-Smoking patients. In this study, we used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the effect of smoking on attention in patients with COPD. Behavioral analysis revealed that among patients with COPD the smokers had a shorter course of COPD and showed a worse attention performance than the non-smokers. Resting-state fMRI analysis revealed that among patients with COPD smokers showed lower regional homogeneity (ReHo) value of the fusiform gyrus than non-smokers. Importantly, the ReHo of the fusiform gyrus is positively associated with attention and mediates the effect of smoking on attention in COPD. In summary, our study provides behavioral and neurobiological evidence supporting the positive effect of smoking on attention in COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease leading to further morbidity and significant mortality. The first step for any condition is to make the appropriate diagnosis, and spirometry barriers abound in practice around the world. It is tempting to undertake mass screening on all smokers to detect COPD. While this would pick up cases of COPD, results of studies of its effect on COPD end-points such as exacerbations, hospitalisations and mortality are disappointing. As such, aggressive case finding of COPD by screening for symptoms that patients may not themselves perceive is very important in primary care, with subsequent spirometry defining the diagnosis.We also have to separate out population screening from individual patient interactions. Performing spirometry, even on a truly asymptomatic patient, may allow earlier diagnosis and modification of risk factors such as smoking (mostly) and exacerbation risk. It also recognises patients with early disease who are at high risk of comorbidities such as cardiac illness, such that appropriate treatment strategies can be implemented. Making a diagnosis, and even the fact of worrying about such a diagnosis, can affect the motivational level of the individual patient to cease smoking; all patients should of course be counselled to stop smoking. As such, consider the individual patient in front of you for unrecognised symptoms and therefore unrecognised illness, as making a diagnosis earlier can allow the institution of care, including smoking cessation, vaccination, bronchodilators and comorbidity management.",pubmed

Sub-Saharan Africa's rapid pace of urbanization, economic expansion, and population growth raise concerns of increasing incidence of NCRDs. This research characterizes the state of research on pollution and NCRDs in the 46 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This research systematically reviewed the literature on studies of asthma; chronic bronchitis; allergic rhinitis; and air pollutants such as particulate matter, ozone, NOx, and sulfuric oxide. We searched three major databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) using the key words ""asthma"", ""chronic bronchitis"", ""allergic rhinitis"", and ""COPD"" with ""carbon monoxide (CO)"", ""sulfuric oxide (SO)"", ""ozone (O3)"", ""nitrogen dioxide (NO2)"", and ""particulate matter (PM)"", restricting the search to the 46 countries that comprise SSA. Only papers published in scholarly journals with a defined health outcome in individuals and which tested associations with explicitly measured or modelled air exposures were considered for inclusion. All candidate papers were entered into a database for review. We found a total of 362 unique research papers in the initial search of the three databases. Among these, 14 met the inclusion criteria. These papers comprised studies from just five countries. Nine papers were from South Africa; two from Malawi; and one each from Ghana, Namibia, and Nigeria. Most studies were cross-sectional. Exposures to ambient air pollutants were measured using spectrometry and chromatography. Some studies created composite measures of air pollution using a range of data layers. NCRD outcomes were measured by self-reported health status and measures of lung function (spirometry). Populations of interest were primarily schoolchildren, though a few studies focused on secondary school students and adults. The paucity of research on NCRDs and ambient air pollutant exposures is pronounced within the African continent.

Here, we present recent lung microbiome data, specifically in the context of smoking, COPD, and exacerbations. In contrast to the sterile lung environment found with conventional microbiology, microbiome techniques demonstrate a lower respiratory tract microbiome in health. Alterations in the lung microbiome with smoking and COPD have been clearly demonstrated by culture techniques, however, the findings in microbiome studies are limited and controversial. Increasing COPD disease severity is associated with a reduction in microbial diversity. Though microbial community structure does not change with exacerbation, there are notable changes in its composition. Antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD have significant but opposing effects on microbiome composition.

Ten days after exposure, the estimated median pulmonary translocation of UFC particles was 22.8 and 25.8% for COPD and IPF, respectively. Bound activity was present in blood throughout the test period, peaking at 24-h postinhalation with a median concentration of 5.6 and 8.9 Bq/ml for the COPD and IPF, respectively. Median bound activity excreted in urine (% of inhaled) after 10 days was 1.4% in COPD and 0.7% in IPF. Activity accumulation in liver and spleen could not be demonstrated.

Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with increased chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk, with smoking and poor diet as major contributing factors.

This study analyzed data from 32,836 US adults in the NHANES (1999-2020) and 131,872 UK adults in the UK Biobank. SES was assessed via latent class analysis based on income, education, employment, and health insurance (NHANES). SES was categorized into high, middle, and low levels. Healthy lifestyle scores included nonsmoking, no heavy drinking, regular physical activity, and a high-quality diet. Weighted multivariable logistic regression (NHANES) and Cox proportional hazards models (UK Biobank) were used to assess the associations between SES and the prevalence (NHANES) or incidence (UK Biobank) of COPD. In the UK Biobank, the incidences of newly diagnosed COPD in the high-, medium-, and low-SES groups were 1.27%, 2.92%, and 6.57%, respectively. In the U.S. NHANES, the prevalence rates of COPD were 2.55%, 2.53%, and 4.50%, respectively. Compared with the highest SES group, a low SES was a risk factor for both the incidence and prevalence of COPD (UK Biobank: HR = 3.27, 95% CI = 2.98 to 3.58; NHANES: OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.23 to 2.10). The percentages of the mediation effect of a healthy lifestyle in the UK Biobank and US NHANES were 2.81% and 37.27%, respectively.

Patients diagnosed with ACOS between 2011 and 2015 were identified and classified into four phenotype groups. Group A was composed of patients who smoked <10 pack years and had blood eosinophil counts ≥300. Group B was composed of patients who smoked <10 pack years and had blood eosinophil counts <300. Group C was composed of patients who smoked ≥10 pack years and had blood eosinophil counts ≥300. Group D was composed of patients who smoked <10 pack years and had blood eosinophil counts <300. Clinical characteristics were analyzed and compared among groups. Comparisons were made among 103 ACOS patients. Patients in group D were oldest, while patients in group A were youngest. There were relatively more female patients in groups A and B; the majority of patients in groups C and D were male. The degree of airflow obstruction was most severe in group C. The rate of being free of severe exacerbation was significantly lower in group C than in the other groups. In this study, each ACOS phenotype showed different characteristics. The proportion of patients free of severe exacerbation differed significantly among groups. At this time, further studies on the phenotypes of ACOS are required.",pubmed

Conventional cigarette smoking is known to result in significant COPD morbidity and mortality. Strategies to reduce and/or stop smoking in this highly vulnerable patient group are key public health priorities to reduce COPD morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, smoking cessation efforts in patients with COPD are poor and there is a compelling need for more efficient approaches to cessation for patients with COPD. Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are devices that use batteries to vaporize nicotine. They may facilitate quit attempts and cessation in many smokers. Although they are not risk free, ECs are much less harmful than tobacco smoking. Hence, the use of ECs in vulnerable groups and in patients with challenges to abstain or multiple relapses to this habit may be promising. To date, little is known about health consequences of EC use among COPD smokers and whether their regular use has any effects on subjective and objective COPD outcomes. In the current review, we discuss the current perspectives and literature on the role of ECs in abstaining from conventional smoking and the effects of ECs on the respiratory tract in patients with COPD.",pubmed

Cigarette smoking is known to be the leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the detailed mechanisms have not been elucidated. PAF (platelet-activating factor), a potent inflammatory mediator, is involved in the pathogenesis of various respiratory diseases such as bronchial asthma and COPD. We focused on LPLAT9 (lysophospholipid acyltransferase 9), a biosynthetic enzyme of PAF, in the pathogenesis of COPD. LPLAT9 gene expression was observed in excised COPD lungs and single-cell RNA sequencing data of alveolar macrophages (AMs). LPLAT9 was predominant and upregulated in AMs, particularly monocyte-derived AMs, in patients with COPD. To identify the function of LPLAT9/PAF in AMs in the pathogenesis of COPD, we exposed systemic LPLAT9-knockout (LPALT9<sup>-/-</sup>) mice to cigarette smoke (CS). CS increased the number of AMs, especially the monocyte-derived fraction, which secreted MMP12 (matrix metalloprotease 12). Also, CS augmented LPLAT9 phosphorylation/activation on macrophages and, subsequently, PAF synthesis in the lung. The LPLAT9<sup>-/-</sup> mouse lung showed reduced PAF production after CS exposure. Intratracheal PAF administration accumulated AMs by increasing MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1). After CS exposure, AM accumulation and subsequent pulmonary emphysema, a primary pathologic change of COPD, were reduced in LPALT9<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with LPLAT9<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Notably, these phenotypes were again worsened by LPLAT9<sup>+/+</sup> bone marrow transplantation in LPALT9<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Thus, CS-induced LPLAT9 activation in monocyte-derived AMs aggravated pulmonary emphysema via PAF-induced further accumulation of AMs. These results suggest that PAF synthesized by LPLAT9 has an important role in the pathogenesis of COPD.",pubmed

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major global cause of morbidity and mortality; however, evidence on the effects of air pollutant mixtures on COPD remains limited. This study assessed the impact of long-term exposure to multiple pollutants on COPD prevalence and identified vulnerable subgroups. We analyzed Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2010-2017) data linked to 5-year moving average concentrations of CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, PM₂.₅, and PM₁₀. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) estimated the combined effects of pollutants on COPD prevalence, with subgroup analyses performed according to sex, smoking status, and airflow limitation. Adjustments included age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and household income. Among 21,804 participants, 3515 had COPD. BKMR analysis showed that long-term exposure to a pollutant mixture was associated with increased COPD prevalence. O₃ and NO₂ were identified as the most influential pollutants (posterior inclusion probabilities > 0.50). Further analysis showed a significant increase in COPD risk with higher NO₂ and O₃ concentrations, particularly when other pollutants were at lower or median levels. Significant interactions were observed, particularly between SO₂ and CO, CO and O₃, and NO₂ and O₃. Subgroup analyses identified vulnerable populations, indicating stronger associations among females and never smokers and more pronounced effects in individuals with GOLD 2-4.

Multivariable analysis assessed self-report of COPD diagnosis as a function of age started smoking (<15 yr vs. ⩾15 yr) adjusting for current smoking, cigarette pack-years, and covariates. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Overall, 7.1% reported that they had COPD, 2.6% for never-smokers compared with 23.1% and 11.6% for smoking onset <15 and ⩾15 years, respectively. Persons who began smoking regularly at <15 years of age had higher pack-years of smoking (median, 29 vs. 15, respectively), and higher smoking intensity (median, 20 cigarettes/d for <15 yr vs. 10 cigarettes/d for ⩾15 yr for current smokers). In the multivariable analysis, the relative risk for COPD among childhood smokers was 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 1.22-1.63) compared with later-onset smokers.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease with high prevalence, high mortality and high costs across the globe. Small airways are major sites contributing to airway resistance and the small airway disorder (SAD) is frequently implicated in early-stage COPD. Smoking is recognized as the leading cause of COPD and SAD. This study aimed to investigate the status quo and influencing factors of smoking cessation in patients with SAD or COPD, which is crucial for improving prevention and treatment of chronic airway diseases. In this multicenter, prospective cohort investigation, questionnaire survey and one-year follow-up study were conducted in SAD and COPD patients with smoking history. The rate of quitting intention, quitting attempt and recent smoking cessation of SAD or different stages of COPD and their influencing factors were recorded, compared and analyzed. A total of 386 valid questionnaires were collected. The rate of quitting intention was 91.7% (95% CI: 88.53-94.07%), and quitting attempt was 73.6% (95% CI: 68.96-77.73%). Regular bronchodilator use, alcohol abstinence, and the lower Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) scores were associated with a higher intention to quit smoking. Further, inpatients with higher mMRC scores, non-smoking parents, engagement in pulmonary rehabilitation exercises, and receipt of medical advice to quit were more likely to attempt quitting smoking. In the one-year follow-up survey, the overall recent smoking cessation rate was 23.9%. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that higher mMRC grade, carrying out pulmonary rehabilitation exercise and the quitting intention were positive factors for quitting smoking, while outpatients with lower educational level, higher FTND score and Tobacco Craving Questionnaire-Short Form (TCQ-SF) scores were negative influencing factors for recent smoking cessation. Patients with SAD and COPD generally had a high willingness to quit smoking, but a significant reduction in the success rate of smoking cessation. Factors influencing smoking cessation included the severity of the illness, nicotine dependence, patient self-control, lifestyle and environment.",pubmed

We used data from the Korea COPD Subgroup Study (KOCOSS) database, which is a multicenter cohort that recruits patients from 54 medical centres in Korea. Comprehensive comparisons of smoking and non-smoking COPD patients were performed based on general characteristics, exacerbations, symptom scores, radiological findings, and lung-function tests.

Using a mouse COPD model induced by cigarette smoke exposure or elastase-induced emphysema, we modulated SCFA levels through dietary interventions and antibiotics to evaluate their effects on inflammation and alveolar destruction. Human smokers showed lower plasma SCFA concentrations than non-smokers, with plasma propionic acid positively correlating with forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity. Three-month smoking-exposed mice demonstrated altered gut microbiota and significantly reduced fecal SCFA concentrations compared to air-exposed controls. In these mice, a high-fiber diet increased fecal SCFAs and mitigated inflammation and alveolar destruction, while antibiotics decreased fecal SCFAs and exacerbated disease features. However, in the elastase-induced model, fecal SCFA concentration remained unchanged, and high-fiber diet or antibiotic interventions had no significant effect.

We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study based on data from the EPISCAN-II study (n=9092). All participants underwent a face-to-face interview and post-bronchodilator spirometry was performed. COPD was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC<70%. Parametric and nonparametric logistic regression models with generalized additive models were used. 8819 persons were included; 858 with COPD and 7961 without COPD. The COPD risk increased with smoking duration up to ≥50 years [OR 3.5 (95% CI: 2.3-5.4)], with smoking intensity up to ≥39cig/day [OR 10.1 (95% CI: 5.3-18.4)] and with lifetime tobacco consumption up to >29 pack-years [OR 3.8 (95% CI: 3.1-4.8)]. The COPD risk for those who started smoking at 22 or later was 0.9 (95% CI: 0.6-1.4). The risk of COPD decreased with increasing years of cessation. In comparison with both never smokers and current smokers, the lowest risk of COPD was found after 15-25 years of abstinence. COPD risk increases with duration, intensity, and lifetime tobacco consumption and decreases importantly with years of abstinence. Age at smoking initiation shows no effect. After 15-25 years of cessation, COPD risk could be equal to that of a never smoker. This work suggests that the time it takes to develop COPD in a smoker is about 30 years.",pubmed

The findings of our study suggest that smokers who are older, have a lower BMI, and comorbid asthma are at an increased risk of developing COPD. Conversely, higher consumption of fruits and vegetables, as well as increased intake of vitamin C, may help reduce this risk. Additionally, our results indicate that among smokers with lower fruit and vegetable intake, COPD patients tend to have lower levels of vitamin C consumption.",pubmed

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Not much is known regarding the influence of non-smoking-related risk factors on COPD in Taiwan. We examined the relationship between exposure to particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and COPD among nonsmokers in Taiwan. This population-based study involved 3941 nonsmoking Taiwanese adults who were recruited in the Taiwan Biobank project between 2008 and 2015. Air pollution data between 2006 and 2011 were obtained from the air quality monitoring database (AQMD). COPD was the outcome of interest and was identified using the National health insurance Research Database (NHIRD). The data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression models. Compared with the lowest quartile (PM<sub>2.5</sub> = 29.38), exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the highest quartile (>38.98 μg/m<sup>3</sup>) was significantly associated with COPD (OR, 1.29; CI 1.01-1.65) after multivariate adjustments. However, exposures to concentrations of 32.07-38.98 μg/m<sup>3</sup> (OR, 1.12 CI 0.88-1.44) and 29.38-32.07 μg/m<sup>3</sup> (OR, 1.09 CI 0.84-1.41) showed positive but non-significant associations. However, the test for trend was significant (Ptrend = 0.043). The ORs for exposure to sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and NOx (nitrogen monoxide (NO were not significant. Based on our data, exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> at concentrations greater than 38.98 μg/m<sup>3</sup> increased susceptibility to COPD among Taiwanese nonsmokers.

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), endothelial dysfunction and stiffness of systemic arteries may contribute to increased cardiovascular risk. Pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) is frequent in COPD. The association between PVD and systemic vascular dysfunction has not been thoroughly evaluated in COPD. A total of 108 subjects were allocated into four groups (non-smoking controls, smoking controls, COPD without PVD and COPD with PVD). In systemic arteries, endothelial dysfunction was assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and arterial stiffness by pulse wave analysis (PWA) and pulse wave velocity (PWV). PVD was defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) ≥25 mmHg at right heart catheterization or by a tricuspid regurgitation velocity >2.8 m/s at doppler echocardiography. Biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial damage were assessed in peripheral blood. FMD was lower in COPD patients, with or without PVD, compared to non-smoking controls; and in patients with COPD and PVD compared to smoking controls. PWV was higher in COPD with PVD patients compared to both non-smoking and smoking controls in a model adjusted by age and the Framingham score; PWV was also higher in patients with COPD and PVD compared to COPD without PVD patients in the non-adjusted analysis. FMD and PWV correlated significantly with forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DL<sub>CO</sub>) and systolic PAP. FMD and PWV were correlated in all subjects. We conclude that endothelial dysfunction of systemic arteries is common in COPD, irrespective if they have PVD or not. COPD patients with PVD show increased stiffness and greater impairment of endothelial function in systemic arteries. These findings suggest the association of vascular impairment in both pulmonary and systemic territories in a subset of COPD patients.",pubmed

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) is recognized increasingly as a distinct clinical entity and is associated with higher comorbidities compared with patients with asthma and COPD alone. Little is known about the leading causes of death related to ACO in the US general population, however. Our aim was to define the causes of mortality among patients with ACO compared with asthma and COPD in the US population. We examined questions using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III database linked to the National Death Index. The data from 4434 participants were stratified into 4 groups, those with asthma, COPD, ACO, and those without any obstructive lung disease. We examined baseline demographics and used multivariate logistic regression to model the impact of demographics, smoking, and self-reported, physician-diagnosed lung disease on mortality generating odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs). Among 4434 participants, 120 (2.7%), 340 (7.6%), and 126 (2.8%) participants self-reported diagnoses of asthma, COPD, and ACO syndrome, respectively. Patients with COPD were older (69.7 ± 10.9 years) than other groups. Cardiovascular disease, malignancy, and chronic lower respiratory disease were frequent causes of death. The mortality rates for cardiovascular disease and malignancy were not significantly different among respiratory disease categories. Deaths resulting from chronic respiratory disease were higher in the ACO group (OR 4.9, 95% CI 2.5-9.4) and the COPD group (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.4) when compared with those without obstructive lung disease (<i>P</i> < 0.0001).

Chronic bronchitis is a frequent accompaniment of COPD, which increases the burden of COPD in affected individuals. The aim of this study was to characterize the phenotype of chronic bronchitis in COPD patients. The study was based on the survey data retrospectively retrieved from the Action Health-Lung Cancer Prophylaxis and Health Care Improvement screening program that concerned all the inhabitants, aged over 40, of the Proszowice administrative region situated in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship in southern Poland. Participants with the symptoms suggestive of a lung disease were subject to further evaluation. The findings were that 546 (13.3%) out of the 4105 individuals displayed spirometry features of COPD. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis were present in 92 (16.8%) out of the COPD afflicted persons. Chronic bronchitis was commoner in current smokers and its incidence increased with increasing severity of airway obstruction. In multivariate analysis, chronic bronchitis was independently related to lower FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, and to dyspnea. In regression model, factors related to increased risk of chronic bronchitis were current smoking, asthma, and lower lung function. We conclude that COPD with coexisting chronic bronchitis is linked to severer dyspnea and worse lung function.

Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) often have multiple comorbid conditions that may interact with each other, confound the choice of treatments, and reduce mortality. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most important comorbidities of CVD, which causes serious consequences in patients with ischemic heart disease, stroke, arrhythmia, and heart failure. COPD shares common risk factors such as tobacco smoking and aging with CVD, is associated with less physical activity, and produces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Overall, patients with COPD have a 2-3-fold increased risk of CVD as compared to age-matched controls when adjusted for tobacco smoking. Chronic heart failure (HF) is a frequent and important comorbidity which has a significant impact on prognosis in COPD, and vice versa. HF overlaps in symptoms and signs and has a common comorbidity with COPD, so that diagnosis of COPD is difficult in patients with HF. The combination of HF and COPD presents many therapeutic challenges including beta-blockers (BBs) and beta-agonists. Inhaled long-acting bronchodilators including beta2-agonists and anticholinergics for COPD would not worsen HF. Diuretics are relatively safe, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are preferred to treat HF accompanied with COPD. BBs are only relatively contraindicated in asthma, but not in COPD. Low doses of cardioselective BBs should be aggressively initiated in clinically stable patients with HF accompanied with COPD combined with close monitoring for signs of airway obstruction and gradually up-titrated to the maximum tolerated dose. Encouraging appropriate and aggressive treatment for both HF and COPD should be recommended to improve quality of life and mortality in HF patients with COPD.",pubmed

This study utilized the GBD 2019 to compare the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate, and the proportion attributed to different risk factors in China, the United States, and India. Joinpoint models and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were employed to capture the changing trends in disease burden and forecast outcomes. From 1990 to 2019, China's age-standardized COPD incidence and mortality rates decreased by 29% and 70%, respectively. In the same period, India's rates decreased by 8% and 33%, while the United States saw an increase of 9% in COPD incidence and a 22% rise in mortality rates. Smoking and ambient particulate matter pollution are the two most significant risk factors for COPD, while household air pollution from solid fuels and low temperatures are the least impactful factors in the United States and India, respectively. The proportion of risk from household air pollution from solid fuels is higher in India than in China and the United States. Predictions for 2030 suggest that the age-standardized DALY rates, ASIR, and ASMR in the United States and India are expected to remain stable or decrease, while China's age-standardized incidence rate is projected to rise. Over the past three decades, the incidence of COPD has been decreasing in China and India, while showing a slight increase in the United States.

While some of these factors are obviously impossible to prevent or eliminate, others have been proven to have a protective role, and current research is aimed optimizing them. Available prophylactic measures are also reviewed. In the case of environmental pollution, large scale political interventions successfully managed to decrease contamination levels, leading to improved lung function and lower asthma prevalence in the respective geographical areas.

The persistent airway inflammation is the main characteristic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), typically caused by an indoor environment pollution cigarette smoke (CS). METTL16 is an m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase that has been proven to be closely associated with the occurrence of various diseases. However, its exact role in smoking-induced COPD remains to be investigated. In this study, we found that the level of METTL16 was aberrantly decreased in lung tissues of COPD smokers. Similarly, murine model induced by CS and lung epithelial cell model induced by cigarette smoke extract (CSE) also confirmed this discovery. Moreover, in the Mettl16-deficient (Mettl16<sup>+/-</sup>) mice challenged with CS, airway inflammation was aggravated. To identify the potential target genes and regulatory pathways through METTL16, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (meRIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and metabolomic profiling were used. Knockdown of METTL16 significantly reduced the stability of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2) and downregulated its expression through m<sup>6</sup>A modification, while reprogramed glutamine metabolism in lung epithelial cells. Significant reduction in inflammation levels was observed in the 3-month COPD murine model fed a glutamine-supplemented diet. Mechanistically, METTL16 could regulate lung epithelial mitochondrial function by participating in the reprogramming of glutamine metabolism.

To identify them, we have integrated information across different biological levels (i.e., genetic variants, lung-specific 3D genome structure, gene expression and protein-protein interactions) to build lung-specific gene regulatory and protein-protein interaction networks. We have queried these networks using disease-associated SNPs for COPD, unipolar depression and coronary artery disease. COPD-associated SNPs can control genes involved in the regulation of lung or pulmonary function, asthma, brain region volumes, cortical surface area, depressed affect, neuroticism, Parkinson's disease, white matter microstructure and smoking behaviour.

Crude prevalence rates of asthma, dyspnea, and chronic cough were presented as percentages, and the results of their association with subjective health status were presented as odds ratios and corresponding 95% CIs. Prevalence of daily smoking was highest in Bangladesh (39.9%) and lowest in Sri Lanka (14.1%). Prevalence of asthma was highest in India (6.3%), while Nepal had the highest prevalence of dyspnea (11.3%) and chronic cough (15.3%). Overall prevalence of asthma and dyspnea was higher among women, while that of chronic cough was higher among men. Significant differences were observed in the prevalence rates of all the conditions among regular, occasional, and nonsmokers. A majority of the men and women who had asthma, dyspnea, and chronic cough had higher likelihood of reporting poor health status compared to those who did not have these diseases. Findings suggest that prevalence rates of asthma, dyspnea, and chronic cough were considerably high in all the countries and were significantly associated with poor subjective health. Being a high COPD-prone region, programs targeted to address these diseases could help reduce the burden of COPD and respiratory disease-related mortalities in South Asia.",pubmed

Background: The characteristics of community members exposed to World Trade Center (WTC) dust and fumes with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) can provide insight into mechanisms of airflow obstruction in response to an environmental insult, with potential implications for interventions. Methods: We performed a baseline assessment of respiratory symptoms, spirometry, small airway lung function measures using respiratory impulse oscillometry (IOS), and blood biomarkers. COPD was defined by the 2019 GOLD criteria for COPD. Patients in the WTC Environmental Health Center with <5 or ≥5 pack year smoking history were classified as nonsmoker-COPD (ns-COPD) or smoker-COPD (sm-COPD), respectively. Main Results: Between August 2005 and March 2018, 467 of the 3430 evaluated patients (13.6%) fit criteria for COPD. Among patients with COPD, 248 (53.1%) were ns-COPD. Patients with ns-COPD had measures of large airway function (FEV1) and small airway measures (R5−20, AX) that were less abnormal than those with sm-COPD. More ns-COPD compared to sm-COPD had a bronchodilator (BD) response measured by spirometry (24 vs. 14%, p = 0.008) or by IOS (36 vs. 21%, p = 0.002). Blood eosinophils did not differ between ns-COPD and sm-COPD, but blood neutrophils were higher in sm-COPD compared to ns-COPD (p < 0.001). Those with sm-COPD were more likely to be WTC local residents than ns-COPD (p = 0.007). Conclusions: Spirometry findings and small airway measures, as well as inflammatory markers, differed between patients with ns-COPD and sm-COPD. These findings suggest potential for differing mechanisms of airway injury in patients with WTC environmental exposures and have potential therapeutic implications.",pubmed

Although COPD among non-smokers (NS-COPD) is common, little is known about this phenotype. We compared NS-COPD subjects with smoking COPD (S-COPD) patients in a rural Indian population using a variety of clinical, physiological, radiological, sputum cellular and blood biomarkers. Two hundred ninety subjects (118 healthy, 79 S-COPD, 93 NS-COPD) performed pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry and were followed for 2 years to study the annual rate of decline in lung function. Body plethysmography, impulse oscillometry, inspiratory-expiratory HRCT, induced sputum cellular profile and blood biomarkers were compared between 49 healthy, 45 S-COPD and 55 NS-COPD subjects using standardized methods. Spirometric response to oral corticosteroids was measured in 30 female NS-COPD patients. Compared to all male S-COPD subjects, 47% of NS-COPD subjects were female, were younger by 3.2 years, had greater body mass index, a slower rate of decline in lung function (80 vs 130 mL/year), more small airways obstruction measured by impulse oscillometry (p < 0.001), significantly less emphysema (29% vs 11%) on CT scans, lower values in lung diffusion parameters, significantly less neutrophils in induced sputum (p < 0.05) and tended to have more sputum eosinophils. Hemoglobin and red cell volume were higher and serum insulin lower in S-COPD compared to NS-COPD. Spirometric indices, symptoms and quality of life were similar between S-COPD and NS-COPD. There was no improvement in spirometry in NS-COPD patients after 2 weeks of an oral corticosteroid. Compared to S-COPD, NS-COPD is seen in younger subjects with equal male-female predominance, is predominantly a small-airway disease phenotype with less emphysema, preserved lung diffusion and a slower rate of decline in lung function.",pubmed

Guidelines are critical for facilitating cost-effective COPD care. Development and implementation in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is challenging. To guide future strategy, an overview of current global COPD guidelines is required. We systematically reviewed national COPD guidelines, focusing on worldwide availability and identification of potential development, content, context, and quality gaps that may hamper effective implementation. Scoping review of national COPD management guidelines. We assessed: (1) global guideline coverage; (2) guideline information (authors, target audience, dissemination plans); (3) content (prevention, diagnosis, treatments); (4) ethical, legal, and socio-economic aspects; and (5) compliance with the eight Institute of Medicine (IOM) guideline standards. LMICs guidelines were compared with those from high-income countries (HICs). Of the 61 national COPD guidelines identified, 30 were from LMICs. Guidelines did not cover 1.93 billion (30.2%) people living in LMICs, whereas only 0.02 billion (1.9%) in HICs were without national guidelines. Compared with HICs, LMIC guidelines targeted fewer health-care professional groups and less often addressed case finding and co-morbidities. More than 90% of all guidelines included smoking cessation advice. Air pollution reduction strategies were less frequently mentioned in both LMICs (47%) and HICs (42%). LMIC guidelines fulfilled on average 3.37 (42%) of IOM standards, compared with 5.29 (66%) in HICs (P < .05). LMICs scored significantly lower compared with HICs regarding conflicts of interest management, updates, articulation of recommendations, and funding transparency (all, P < .05). Several development, content, context, and quality gaps exist in COPD guidelines from LMICs that may hamper effective implementation. Overall, COPD guidelines in LMICs should be more widely available and should be transparently developed and updated. Guidelines may be further enhanced by better inclusion of local risk factors, case findings, and co-morbidity management, preferably tailored to available financial and staff resources.",pubmed

Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) is a known risk factor for offspring developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to explore whether the increased COPD risk associated with MSDP could be attributed to tobacco dependence (TD). This case-control study used data from the nationwide cross-sectional China Pulmonary Health study, with controls matched for age, sex, and smoking status. TD was defined as smoking within 30 minutes of waking, and the severity of TD was assessed using the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence. COPD was diagnosed when the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity was <0.7 in a postbronchodilator pulmonary function test according to the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria. Logistic regression was used to examine the correlation between MSDP and COPD, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, educational attainment, place of residence, ethnic background, occupation, childhood passive smoking, residential fine particulate matter, history of childhood pneumonia or bronchitis, average annual household income, and medical history (coronary heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes). Mediation analysis examined TD as a potential mediator in the link between MSDP and COPD risk. The significance of the indirect effect was assessed through 1000 iterations of the ""bootstrap"" method. The study included 5943 participants (2991 with COPD and 2952 controls). Mothers of the COPD group had higher pregnancy smoking rates (COPD: n=305, 10.20%; controls: n=211, 7.10%; P<.001). TD was more prevalent in the COPD group (COPD: n=582, 40.40%; controls: n=478, 33.90%; P<.001). After adjusting for covariates, MSDP had a significant effect on COPD (β=.097; P<.001). There was an association between MSDP and TD (β=.074; P<.001) as well as between TD and COPD (β=.048; P=.007). Mediation analysis of TD in the MSDP-COPD association showed significant direct and indirect effects (direct: β=.094; P<.001 and indirect: β=.004; P=.03). The indirect effect remains present in the smoking population (direct: β=.120; P<.001 and indirect: β=.002; P=.03). This study highlighted the potential association between MSDP and the risk of COPD in offspring, revealing the mediating role of TD in this association. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact of prenatal tobacco exposure on lung health, laying the groundwork for the development of relevant prevention and treatment strategies.",pubmed

Our aims were to determine whether adherence to the healthful version of a plant-based diet (healthful Plant-based Diet Index (hPDI)) is associated with a lower COPD risk, whereas adherence to the unhealthful version (unhealthful Plant-based Diet Index (uPDI)) is associated with a higher COPD risk. 46,948 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, 73,592 women from the Nurses' Health Study, and 85,515 women from the Nurses' Health Study II who completed biennial questionnaires from 1984-2018. We derived diet scores from repeated validated food frequency questionnaires. Among 5,661,994 person-years of follow-up, we documented 2605 validated COPD cases between 1984-2018. After tight control for smoking and other potential confounders, COPD risk was 46% lower among participants with the highest hPDI score compared to those with the lowest score. Conversely, COPD risk was 39% higher among participants with the highest uPDI. Further adjustment for processed meat intake led to similar results.

There is a paucity of population-based data on COPD prevalence and its determinants in Bangladesh. To measure COPD prevalence and socioeconomic and lifestyle determinants among ≥40 years Bangladeshi adults. In a cross-sectional study, we measured lung function of 3744 randomly selected adults ≥40 years from rural and urban areas in Bangladesh, using a handheld spirometer. COPD was defined according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria as post-bronchodilator ratio of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1st second (FEV1) to Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) < 0.7. In addition, COPD was also assessed by the lower limit of normal (LLN) threshold defined as lower fifth percentile for the predicted FEV1/FVC. The prevalence of COPD was 13.5% by GOLD criteria and 10.3% by LLN criteria. Prevalence of COPD was higher among rural than urban residents and in males than females. More than half of the COPD cases were stage II COPD by both criteria. Milder cases (Stages I and II) were over estimated by the GOLD fixed criteria, but more severe cases (Stages III and IV) were similarly classified. In multiple logistic regression analysis, older age, male sex, illiteracy, underweight, history of smoking (both current and former), history of asthma and solid fuel use were significant predictors of COPD.

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), respiratory manifestations include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). We assessed whether baseline COPD and smoking were associated with RA-ILD onset. We identified new-onset ILD in incident RA subjects within the MarketScan Commercial Claims database, using physician and/or hospitalisation diagnostic codes. Smoking data (current, past, never) were available for a subset via a health questionnaire. Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed time to ILD onset, stratified by prior COPD and smoking. Multivariate Cox regression models were adjusted for age, sex, and (in the subset) smoking. Sensitivity analyses adjusted for past RA drugs. Among 373,940 new RA subjects, 6343 (1.7%) developed ILD (8.1 events per 1000 person-year, 95% CI 7.9, 8.3). ILD was more common among subjects with baseline COPD. Adjusting for age and sex, the hazard ratio (HR) between baseline COPD and incident ILD was 2.15, 95% CI 1.93, 2.39. We could not establish a clear relationship between current smoking and ILD; in the subset with smoking data, the HR point estimate for COPD was similar but the 95% CI was wider (due to fewer subjects) and included the null value. Adjusting for baseline RA drugs did not change results. Pre-existing COPD in incident RA subjects was associated with higher risk of future ILD. While a trend persisted after adjusting for smoking, we were limited by reduced sample size.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common lung injury diseases, closely associated with aging, air pollution and smoking exposure. The novel epigenetic modification 7-methylguanosine (m7G) RNA methylation affects the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. In this study, the combined roles of m7G methylation regulators were explored in COPD for the first time by integrated bioinformatic methods. The machine algorithms screened 7 disease signature genes relevant to clinical indicators, including CYFIP2, EIF3D, EIF4G3, GEMIN5, METTL1, SNUPN and NCBP2, and METTL1 was related to the progression in COPD. COPD patients could be well divided into two m7G subtypes by consensus clustering, and the two groups had differential immune profiles, visualized by single-cell sequencing and immune infiltration landscapes. More importantly, CAT was found to be a meaningful key target gene in METTL1-CAT axis for m7G methylation in COPD. We also used the cell premature senescence model for the preliminary validation of the above biosignature analysis results. The qRT-PCR and GSEA results revealed the important regulatory roles of the seven disease signature genes in COPD and aging-related diseases.

The Socioeconomic and Environmental Risk Score is more predictive of COPD than smoking status and pack-years. Individuals in the highest decile of the risk score have a greater risk for incident COPD compared to the remaining population. Never smokers in the highest decile of exposure risk are more likely to develop COPD than previous and current smokers in the lowest decile. In general, the prediction accuracy of the Social and Environmental Risk Score is lower in non-European populations.

While the relationship between the underlying disease and diet is natural in conditions such as metabolic disorders, obesity, diabetes, etc., the direct effect is not so evident in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Poor diet quality and the development of nutrient deficiencies in respiratory diseases, including COPD, can be associated with disease-specific factors such as the exacerbation of respiratory symptoms. These symptoms can be improved by dietary interventions, leading to positive changes in the pathogenesis of the disease and the quality of life of patients. Therefore, our aim was to review the latest randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of dietary interventions in chronic respiratory patients and describe their effects on respiratory function, physical activity, systemic inflammatory parameters, and quality of life.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic, inflammatory respiratory disease that obstructs airflow and decreases lung function and is a leading cause death globally. In the United States (US), the prevalence among adults is 6.2%, but increases with age to 12.8% among those 65 years or older. Florida has one of the largest populations of older adults in the US, accounting for 4.5 million adults 65 years or older. This makes Florida an ideal geographic location for investigating COPD as disease prevalence increases with age. Understanding the geographic disparities in COPD and potential associations between its disparities and environmental factors as well as population characteristics is useful in guiding intervention strategies. Thus, the objectives of this study are to investigate county-level geographic disparities of COPD prevalence in Florida and identify county-level socio-demographic predictors of COPD prevalence. This ecological study was performed in Florida using data obtained from the US Census Bureau, Florida Health CHARTS, and County Health Rankings and Roadmaps. County-level COPD prevalence for 2019 was age-standardized using the direct method and 2020 US population as the standard population. High-prevalence spatial clusters of COPD were identified using Tango's flexible spatial scan statistics. Predictors of county-level COPD prevalence were investigated using multivariable ordinary least squares model built using backwards elimination approach. Multicollinearity of regression coefficients was assessed using variance inflation factor. Shapiro-Wilks, Breusch Pagan, and robust Lagrange Multiplier tests were used to assess for normality, homoskedasticity, and spatial autocorrelation of model residuals, respectively. County-level age-adjusted COPD prevalence ranged from 4.7% (Miami-Dade) to 16.9% (Baker and Bradford) with a median prevalence of 9.6%. A total of 6 high-prevalence clusters with prevalence ratios >1.2 were identified. The primary cluster, which was also the largest geographic cluster that included 13 counties, stretched from Nassau County in north-central Florida to Charlotte County in south-central Florida. However, cluster 2 had the highest prevalence ratio (1.68) and included 10 counties in north-central Florida. Together, the primary cluster and cluster 2 covered most of the counties in north-central Florida. Significant predictors of county-level COPD prevalence were county-level percentage of residents with asthma and the percentage of current smokers. There is evidence of spatial clusters of COPD prevalence in Florida. These patterns are explained, in part, by differences in distribution of some health behaviors (smoking) and co-morbidities (asthma). This information is important for guiding intervention efforts to address the condition, reduce health disparities, and improve population health.",pubmed

Patients with COPD of the COSYCONET cohort with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades 1-4 and the former grade 0 were included. The evaluated outcomes included mortality, exacerbation risk, the comorbidities asthma, cardiac disease (coronary artery disease/heart failure), osteoporosis, and emphysema, for which a reduction in carbon monoxide transfer coefficient (KCO) <55% predicted was considered as marker. Analyses were performed by Cox proportional hazard or logistic multiple regression analyses separately for smokers and nonsmokers. In total, 2509 patients had complete data, among them 1884 nonsmokers (ex or never; 38.4% female; mean age±SD 66.1±8.5 years) and 625 current smokers (45.1% female, 61.6±7.9 years). The pattern of responses to the single questions of the CAT differed between outcome variables, as well as between smokers and nonsmokers, but in most cases the total score was superior to the single items. The CAT total score was associated with mortality (p<0.05) only in nonsmokers, while for exacerbation frequency/severity, it was of about equal importance in smokers and nonsmokers. Regarding KCO, the total score was indicative (p<0.05) only in nonsmokers. Particularly in smokers, single items could show opposite signs of their coefficients which therefore largely cancelled in the total score. Our results show in detail for which outcomes single items are informative in nonsmokers and current smokers with COPD, overall being more informative in nonsmokers. Only regarding exacerbation risk, the predictive value was similar in both groups. These results might be helpful to extract as much as possible information from a COPD questionnaire that is often part of routine assessment. NCT01245933.",pubmed

The club cell secretory protein (CC16) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and low CC16 serum levels have been associated with both risk and progression of COPD, yet the interaction between smoking and CC16 on lung function outcomes remains unknown. Utilizing cross-sectional data on United States veterans, CC16 serum concentrations were measured by ELISA and log transformed for analyses. Spirometry was conducted and COPD status was defined by post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio < 0.7. Smoking measures were self-reported on questionnaire. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were employed to examine associations between CC16 levels and COPD, and lung function with adjustment for covariates. Unadjusted Pearson correlations described relationships between CC16 level and lung function measures, pack-years smoked, and years since smoking cessation. The study population (N = 351) was mostly male, white, with an average age over 60 years. An interaction between CC16 and smoking status on FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio was demonstrated among subjects with COPD (N = 245, p = 0.01). There was a positive correlation among former smokers and negative correlation among current or never smokers with COPD. Among former smokers with COPD, CC16 levels were also positively correlated with years since smoking cessation, and inversely related with pack-years smoked. Increasing CC16 levels were associated with lower odds of COPD (OR<sub>adj</sub> = 0.36, 95% CI 0.22-0.57, P<sub>adj</sub> < 0.0001). Smoking status is an important effect modifier of CC16 relationships with lung function. Increasing serum CC16 corresponded to increases in FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio in former smokers with COPD versus opposite relationships in current or never smokers. Additional longitudinal studies may be warranted to assess relationship of CC16 with smoking cessation on lung function among subjects with COPD.",pubmed

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by sustained inflammation of the airways, leading to destruction of lung tissue and declining pulmonary function. Although smoking is the most obvious risk factor for COPD, only about 20% of smokers develop COPD and smoking cessation does not reverse progression of COPD, indicating that while smoking is an important cause or initiating factor, it is not the only driver of ongoing chronic inflammation and disease progression in COPD patients. We hypothesize that smoking-induced changes in lung microbiota, epithelial integrity and epigenetic control of gene expression result in autoantigen induction and perturbed immune regulation in genetically vunerable individuals. In our view, COPD patients may be stratified according to their immunological and inflammatory status related to specific changes in the lung microbiota (innate and adaptive immunity), presence of autoantigens (adaptive immunity: Th1-B-cell axis) and epigenetic modifications (inflammation and structural changes).",pubmed

Ambient air pollution poses a major risk for the development and aggravation of respiratory diseases. Evidence suggests that even in low-level air pollution environments there is a risk for an increase in adverse respiratory symptoms. We examined whether variations in daily air pollution levels of nitrogen dioxide, ozone, or particulate matter in Berlin, Germany were associated with hospital admissions of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma patients in a time series analysis. We calculated single and multi-pollutant models, investigated possible lags in effect, and analysed the influence of meteorological variables on the results. Data from January 2005 through December 2015 were used to quantify the concentration-response. The risk ratio for asthma patients to be hospitalised on the same day of NO<sub>2</sub> exposure was 1.101 per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup> NO<sub>2</sub> increase (95% CI: 1.013 to 1.195), for COPD patients 1.123 (95% CI: 1.081 to 1.168).

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease characterized by chronic inflammation and irreversible airway obstruction. Cigarette smoking is the predominant risk factor for developing COPD. It is well-known that the COPD is also strongly associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Cigarette smoke contains elevated concentrations of oxidants and various carcinogens (e.g., tobacco-derived nitrosamines) that can cause oxidative and alkylating stresses, which can also arise from inflammation. However, it is surprising that, except for oxidative stress, little information is available on the burden of alkylating stress and the detoxification efficiency of tobacco-derived carcinogens in COPD patients. In this study, we used LC-MS/MS to measure the archetypical tobacco-specific carcinogenic 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), its major metabolite, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), three biomarkers of oxidative stress (8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, 8-oxoGua; 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, 8-oxodGuo; 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine, 8-oxoGuo) and two biomarkers of alkylating stress (N7-methylguanine, N7-MeGua and N3-methyladenine, N3-MeAde), in the urine of smoking and non-smoking COPD patients and healthy controls. Our results showed that not only was oxidative stress significantly elevated in the COPD patients compared to the controls, but also alkylating stress. Significantly, levels of alkylating stress (i.e., N7-MeGua) were highly correlated with the COPD severity and not affected by age and smoking status. Furthermore, COPD smokers had significantly higher ratios of free NNAL to the total NNAL than control smokers, implying a lower detoxification efficiency of NNK in COPD smokers. This ratio was even higher in COPD smokers with stages 3-4 than in COPD smokers with stages 1-2. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the detoxification efficiency of tobacco-derived carcinogens (e.g., NNK) was associated with the pathogenesis and possibly the progression of COPD. In addition to oxidative stress, alkylating stress derived from chronic inflammation appears to be also dominant in COPD patients.",pubmed

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent respiratory disorder characterized by persistent airway inflammation and progressive airflow limitation, resulting in a significant global health burden and high mortality. This narrative review synthesizes the current evidence on the roles of leukocyte subtypes-including neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils-in the pathogenesis and clinical management of COPD. Relevant original studies and reviews are included, providing data on leukocyte functions, associated biomarkers, and therapeutic implications. Neutrophils contribute to airway damage and remodeling by releasing proteases and reactive oxygen species, particularly in response to environmental exposure such as cigarette smoke or air pollution. Lymphocytes, especially CD8⁺ T cells, drive chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages that promote airway fibrosis and persistent inflammation, further impairing lung function. Eosinophils, though classically linked to asthma, are now recognized for their role in eosinophilic COPD, where they are associated with an increased exacerbation risk and corticosteroid responsiveness. Basophils, though less studied, may influence airway inflammation through interactions with eosinophils and cytokine release. Understanding these immune cell dynamics provides insights into the heterogeneity of COPD and highlights potential targets for precision therapy. Tailored interventions based on inflammatory phenotypes may improve clinical outcomes and advance personalized treatment strategies.",pubmed

Existing comprehensive management strategies for COPD effectively relieve the symptoms of patients, delay the deterioration of lung function, and prevent the progression of COPD through various means and multidisciplinary interventions. However, there has been limited progress in therapies that address the underlying causes of COPD pathogenesis. Recent studies have identified specific changes in the gut and pulmonary microbiota in response to exposure to smoke that can cause or exacerbate CS-COPD by regulating the inflammatory immune response in the lungs through the gut-lung axis. As a convenient and controllable intervention, modifying the diet to include more dietary fiber can effectively improve the prognosis of CS-COPD. Gut microbiota ferment dietary fiber to produce short-chain fatty acids, which connect the microbial communities in the lung and gut mucosa across the gut-lung axis, playing an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive role in the lungs. Given that the effect of dietary fiber on gut microbiota was highly similar to that of quitting smoking on gut microbiota, we assume that microbiota might be a potential therapeutic target for dietary fiber to alleviate and prevent CS-COPD. This study examines the similarities between pulmonary and gut microbiota changes in the presence of smoking and dietary fiber. It also highlights the mechanism by which SCFAs link pulmonary and gut microbiota in CS-COPD and analyzes the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of short-chain fatty acids on CS-COPD <i>via</i> the gut-lung axis.",pubmed

Unfortunately, the epidemiological data concerning the value of MMP´s as biomarkers of COPD and atherosclerosis with special regards to smoking habits are limited. 450 middle-aged subjects with records of smoking habits and tobacco consumption were examined with comprehensive spirometry, carotid ultrasound examination and biomarker analysis of MMP-1, -3, -7, -10 and -12.

Early COPD can be defined as disease occurring in patients younger than 50 years in age with a 10-pack-year or more smoking history and abnormal spirometry, imaging or lung function decline. Childhood exposures (maternal smoking and recurrent respiratory infections), childhood and adult asthma, and smoking affect middle-age lung function. Multiple studies of long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) in mild COPD have shown improvements in lung function and symptoms scores.

Smoking is a leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is known to have a significant impact on gene expression and (inflammatory) cell populations in the airways involved in COPD pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the impact of smoking on the expression of miRNAs in healthy and COPD individuals. We aimed to elucidate the overall smoking-induced miRNA changes and those specific to COPD. In addition, we investigated the downstream effects on regulatory gene expression and the correlation to cellular composition. We performed a genome-wide miRNA expression analysis on a dataset of 40 current- and 22 ex-smoking COPD patients and a dataset of 35 current- and 38 non-smoking respiratory healthy controls and validated the results in an independent dataset. miRNA expression was then correlated with mRNA expression in the same patients to assess potential regulatory effects of the miRNAs. Finally, cellular deconvolution analysis was used to relate miRNAs changes to specific cell populations. Current smoking was associated with increased expression of three miRNAs in the COPD patients and 18 miRNAs in the asymptomatic smokers compared to respiratory healthy controls. In comparison, four miRNAs were lower expressed with current smoking in asymptomatic controls. Two of the three smoking-related miRNAs in COPD, miR-203a-3p and miR-375, were also higher expressed with current smoking in COPD patients and the asymptomatic controls. The other smoking-related miRNA in COPD patients, i.e. miR-31-3p, was not present in the respiratory healthy control dataset. miRNA-mRNA correlations demonstrated that miR-203a-3p, miR-375 and also miR-31-3p expression were negatively associated with genes involved in pro-inflammatory pathways and positively associated with genes involved in the xenobiotic pathway. Cellular deconvolution showed that higher levels of miR-203a-3p were associated with higher proportions of proliferating-basal cells and secretory (club and goblet) cells and lower levels of fibroblasts, luminal macrophages, endothelial cells, B-cells, amongst other cell types. MiR-375 expression was associated with lower levels of secretory cells, ionocytes and submucosal cells, but higher levels of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and mast cells, amongst other cell types. In conclusion, we identified two smoking-induced miRNAs (miR-375 and miR-203a-3p) that play a role in regulating inflammation and detoxification pathways, regardless of the presence or absence of COPD. Additionally, in patients with COPD, we identified miR-31-3p as a miRNA induced by smoking.

Four hundred three individuals with COPD from SPIROMICS and 696 individuals from COPDGene with data about specific IgEs to 10 common allergens and mixes (simultaneous assessment of combination of allergens in similar category) were included. Comparison groups were defined by atopic and asthma status (neither, atopy alone, atopic asthma, nonatopic asthma, with atopy defined as any positive specific IgE (≥0.35 KU/L) to any of the 10 allergens or mixes and asthma defined as self-report of doctor-diagnosed current asthma). Multivariable regression analyses (linear, logistic, and zero inflated negative binomial where appropriate) adjusted for age, sex, race, lung function, smoking status, pack-years smoked, and use of inhaled corticosteroids were used to determine characteristics of groups and relationship with outcomes (exacerbations, clinical outcomes, CT metrics) separately in COPDGene and SPIROMICS, and then adjusted results were combined using meta-analysis. The prevalence of atopy was 35% and 36% in COPD subjects from SPIROMICS and COPDGene, respectively, and less than 50% overlap was seen between atopic status with asthma in both cohorts.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute greatly to increased morbidity, mortality and diminished quality of life. Recent studies report moderately strong positive associations between exposures to several air pollutants and COPD-related emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions (HA). Studies that use clinically defined exacerbations rather than counting ED visits and HA may be more sensitive to environmental triggers like air pollution, but very few such studies exist. Participants in a COPD disease management group living in an area of low air pollution and who were followed closely for the earliest signs of an exacerbation provided an opportunity to study associations between air pollution and COPD exacerbation. Associations between short term exposures to air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and particulate matter < 2.5 microns (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and COPD exacerbation were assessed among 168 patients residing in central Massachusetts, a region with air pollution levels well below USEPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Case-crossover analyses and multivariate conditional logistic regression were used to estimate associations between 7-day average concentrations of each air pollutant, as measured at central site monitors, and COPD exacerbation experienced in the patients' homes during the period 2012-2013, while controlling for temperature and self-reported influenza. We found that short-term exposures to SO<sub>2</sub> were associated with an increase in COPD exacerbation risk (odds ratio (OR) = 2.45, 95 % CI: 1.75-3.45 per 1 ppb increase) after adjustment for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Short-term exposures to NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations showed a weaker association, (OR = 1.17, 95 % CI: 1.05-1.30 per 1 ppb increase) after adjustment for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. An unexpectedly modest negative association was seen for short-term exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Despite living in an area with air pollution concentrations below current USEPA NAAQS, these COPD patients appeared to suffer increased risk of COPD exacerbation following short-term exposures to increased concentrations of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>. An unexpected negative association with PM<sub>2.5</sub> may result from the complex air chemistry of low level PM in this region.",pubmed

Smoking is the primary cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, only 10-20% of smokers develop the disease suggesting possible genomic association in the causation of the disease. In the present study, we aimed to explore the whole genome transcriptomics of blood monocytes from COPD smokers (COPD-S), COPD Ex-smokers (COPD-ExS), Control smokers (CS), and Control Never-smokers (CNS) to understand the differential effects of smoking, COPD and that of smoking cessation. Exploratory analyses in form of principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical component analysis (uHCA) were performed to evaluate the similarity in gene expression patterns, while differential expression analyses of different supervised groups of smokers and never smokers were performed to study the differential effect of smoking, COPD and smoking cessation. Differentially expressed genes among groups were subjected to post-hoc enrichment analysis. Candidate genes were subjected to external validation by quantitative RT-PCR experiments. CNS made a cluster completely segregated from the other three subgroups (CS, COPDS and COPD-ExS). About 550, 8 and 5 genes showed differential expression, respectively, between CNS and CS, between CS and COPD-S, and between COPD-S and COPD-ExS. Apoptosis, immune response, cell adhesion, and inflammation were the top process networks identified in enrichment analysis. Two candidate genes (CASP9 and TNFRSF1A) found to be integral to several pathways in enrichment analysis were validated in an external validation experiment. Control never smokers had formed a cluster distinctively separated from all smokers (COPDS, COPD-ExS, and CS), while amongst all smokers, control smokers had aggregated in a separate cluster. Smoking cessation appeared beneficial if started at an early stage as many genes altered due to smoking started reverting towards the baseline, whereas only a few COPD-related genes showed reversal after smoking cessation.",pubmed

Asthma and osteoarthritis (OA) are medical conditions that inhibit physical activity and adversely affect quality of life. Despite the high prevalence, there are limited studies focusing on the comorbid condition and association between asthma and OA. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of OA co-occurring with asthma and to identify the relevant clinical considerations. Adult participants aged over 40 years who completed questionnaire assessments and spirometry tests were enrolled from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Asthma and OA were defined based on the medical history of a diagnosis made by a doctor. Radiographic severities of OA were measured using the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as a comparative respiratory disease, was diagnosed based on the spirometric results. A total of 9344 subjects were enrolled, and the prevalence of asthma and COPD were 4.6% ± 0.3% and 12.0% ± 0.5%, respectively. The prevalence of OA in the asthma group was 31.9% ± 2.8%, which was significantly higher than that in the COPD (17.8% ± 1.5%) or control (16.2% ± 0.6%) groups. OA was more prevalent in patients with asthma after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and smoking status (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.27-2.13). Furthermore, after adjustment of this model for the prescription of OA medication, OA remained independently associated with asthma (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.10-2.20). Conversely, the relationship of OA medication with asthma was not significant (P = 0.64). This relationship was evident in patients with asthma without airflow limitation measured by spirometry (OR 1.97; 95% CI 1.32-2.93). Moreover, the radiographic severity of knee OA correlated with asthma (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.0-‍‍1.21).

Among them, 43 patients who fulfilled the diagnosis of asthma were defined as having ACO. Among 124 patients with COPD without ACO, 86 with a comparable smoking history and airflow limitation as those with ACO were selected using propensity score matching (matched COPD). The intraluminal area (Ai) and wall thickness (WT) of third- to sixth-generation bronchi were measured and adjusted by body surface area (BSA; Ai/BSA and WT/√BSA, respectively). Patients with ACO had higher respiratory resistance and reactance during tidal breathing, but a smaller gap between the inspiratory and expiratory phases, compared with matched patients with COPD. Patients with ACO had a greater WT/√BSA in third- to fourth-generation bronchi, smaller Ai/BSA in fifth- to sixth-generation bronchi, and less emphysematous changes than did matched patients with COPD.

Development of adult respiratory disease is influenced by events in childhood. The impact of childhood pneumonia on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not well defined. We hypothesize that childhood pneumonia is a risk factor for reduced lung function and COPD in adult smokers. COPD cases and control smokers between 45-80 years old from the United States COPDGene Study were included. Childhood pneumonia was defined by self-report of pneumonia at <16 years. Subjects with lung disease other than COPD or asthma were excluded. Smokers with and without childhood pneumonia were compared on measures of respiratory disease, lung function, and quantitative analysis of chest CT scans. Of 10,192 adult smokers, 854 (8.4%) reported pneumonia in childhood. Childhood pneumonia was associated with COPD (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.17-1.66), chronic bronchitis, increased COPD exacerbations, and lower lung function: post-bronchodilator FEV1 (69.1 vs. 77.1% predicted), FVC (82.7 vs. 87.4% predicted), FEV1/FVC ratio (0.63 vs. 0.67; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Childhood pneumonia was associated with increased airway wall thickness on CT, without significant difference in emphysema. Having both pneumonia and asthma in childhood further increased the risk of developing COPD (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.10-3.18). Children with pneumonia are at increased risk for future smoking-related lung disease including COPD and decreased lung function. This association is supported by airway changes on chest CT scans. Childhood pneumonia may be an important factor in the early origins of COPD, and the combination of pneumonia and asthma in childhood may pose the greatest risk.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. The obesity is a global problem, which is set to increase over time. Chronic obstructive lung disease is the third-leading cause of death globally, and both obesity and diet appear to play roles in its pathophysiology (e.g., role in the development of obstructive sleep apnoea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome). However, the effects of obesity on the respiratory system are often underappreciated. The objective of this study was to compare three anthropometric methods to evaluate of fat mass in COPD patients. Three anthropometric methods of evaluation fat mass in a group of 60 patients with COPD were compared. To the measurement of fat mass were used: (1) Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry method (DEXA), specifically by DEXA densitometer QDR Discovery Wi (S/N 80227) with additional software (Body Composition Analysis); (2) four-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) device Bodystat Quadscan 4000 (Bodystat Ltd, British Isles); (3) skin folds measurement (SFM) with caliper (Harpenden Lange Skinfold Caliper, Cambridge Scientific Industries, Inc. Cambridge, Maryland). The measured values were statistically processed and evaluated in a statistical program Statistica Cz. version 7.1 and Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Los Angeles, CA, USA). Differences among anthropometric methods of measurement fat mass were tested with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). DEXA method, generally accepted for assessing body composition, showed an average value of 22.48 ±11.32 kg of fat mass, which corresponds in percentage terms to the value of 29.62±9.28. BIA method for the parameter fat mass in the monitored group of COPD patients was found the mean value 25.08±10.14 kg (in percentages 30.85±8.15). An average value 28.50±8.08% of fat mass, was determined from the skinfolds measurements (SFM) and subsequent calculations. When comparing these methods (DEXA, BIA and SFM) used to determine body composition, a statistically insignificant difference was found (P >0.05). In this study a good correlation between three anthropometric methods (DEXA, BIA, SFM) for measuring fat mass in patients with COPD and statistically insignificant differences between them were observed. To better define changes in the nutritional status of patients with COPD using anthropometric methods over time, further studies are needed that also monitor the consequences of clinical status, rehabilitation, and nutritional treatment.",pubmed

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease presenting as multiple phenotypes, such as declining lung function, emphysema, or persistent airflow limitation caused by several risk factors, including cigarette smoking and air pollution. The inherent complexity of COPD phenotypes propounds difficulties for accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Although metabolomic profiles on COPD have been reported, the role of metabolism in COPD-related phenotypes is yet to be determined. In this study, we investigated the association between plasma sphingolipids and amino acids, and between COPD and COPD-related phenotypes in a Korean cohort. Blood samples were collected from 120 patients with COPD and 80 control participants who underwent spirometry and quantitative computed tomography. The plasma metabolic profiling was carried out using LC-MS/MS analysis. Among the evaluated plasma sphingolipids, an increase in the metabolism of two specific sphingomyelins, SM (d18:1/24:0) and SM (d18:1/24:1) were significantly associated with COPD. There was no significant correlation between any of the SMs and the emphysema index, FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub> in the COPD cohort. Meanwhile, Cer (d18:1/18:0) and Cer (d18:1/24:1) were significantly associated with reduced FEV<sub>1</sub>. Furthermore, the levels of several amino acids were altered in the COPD group compared to that in the non-COPD group; glutamate and alpha AAA were substantial associated with emphysema in COPD. Kynurenine was the only amino acid significantly associated with reduced FEV<sub>1</sub> in COPD. In contrast, there was no correlation between FVC and the elevated metabolites.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was the third leading cause of death among Americans in 2014. Multiple factors, ranging from proximal (i.e. biological characteristics and behaviors) to distal (i.e. environmental characteristics and policies), have been shown to predict COPD outcomes. The Social Ecological Model (SEM), which specifies that five levels of influence (i.e. intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, community, and public policy factors) are implicated in the development of ill health, has not been used in epidemiological studies of COPD prevalence. A better understanding of the community-level correlates of COPD prevalence may improve community health practice. Using several sources of county-level secondary data ( n = 646), changes in COPD prevalence from 2012 to 2014 were predicted from the five levels of the SEM using ordinary least squares (OLS) hierarchical linear regression. The geographic distribution of county-level changes in COPD prevalence was analyzed with a choropleth map. County-level COPD prevalence increased by 4.76% between 2012 and 2014 overall; however, the greatest increases were observed among counties within the Appalachian region (i.e. counties in West Virginia).

RNA-seq data of bronchial biopsies from three cohorts were analysed using CD. The cohorts included 56 participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] (38 smokers; 18 ex-smokers), 77 participants without COPD (40 never-smokers; 37 smokers) and 16 participants who stopped smoking for 1 year (11 COPD and 5 non-COPD-smokers). Differential gene expression was used to investigate gene expression shifts. The CD-derived goblet cell ratios were validated by correlating with staining-derived goblet cell ratios from the COPD cohort. Statistics were done in the R software (false discovery rate p-value < 0.05). Both CD methods indicate a shift in bronchial-mucus-barrier cell composition towards goblet cells in COPD and non-COPD-smokers compared to ex- and never-smokers. It shows that the effect was reversible within a year of smoking cessation. A reduction of ciliated and basal cells was observed with current smoking, which resolved following smoking cessation. The expression of mucin and sodium channel (ENaC) genes, but not chloride channel genes, were altered in COPD and current smokers compared to never smokers or ex-smokers. The goblet cell-derived staining scores correlate with CD-derived goblet cell ratios. Smoking alters bronchial-mucus-barrier cell composition, transcriptome and increases mucus production.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is mainly associated with smoking habit. Inflammation is the major initiating process whereby neutrophils and monocytes are attracted into the lung microenvironment by external stimuli present in tobacco leaves and in cigarette smoke, which promote chemotaxis, adhesion, phagocytosis, release of superoxide anions and enzyme granule contents. A minority of smokers develops COPD and different molecular factors, which contribute to the onset of the disease, have been put forward. After many years of research, the pathogenesis of COPD is still an object of debate. In vivo models of cigarette smoke-induced COPD may help to unravel cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of COPD. The mouse represents the most favored animal choice with regard to the study of immune mechanisms due to its genetic and physiological similarities to humans, the availability of a large variability of inbred strains, the presence in the species of several genetic disorders analogous to those in man, and finally on the possibility to create models ""made-to-measure"" by genetic manipulation. The review outlines the different response of mouse strains to cigarette smoke used in COPD studies while retaining a strong focus on their relatability to human patients. These studies reveal the importance of innate immunity and cell surface receptors in the pathogenesis of pulmonary injury induced by cigarette smoking. They further advance the way in which we use wild type or genetically manipulated strains to improve our overall understanding of a multifaceted disease such as COPD. The structural and functional features, which have been found in the different strains of mice after chronic exposure to cigarette smoke, can be used in preclinical studies to develop effective new therapeutic agents for the different phenotypes in human COPD.",pubmed

Whereas the detrimental impact of smoking on COPD progression is well documented, the specific effects of smoking status on mortality risk among adults with COPD require further elucidation. Thus, this study investigates the relationship between smoking status (current smoker, former smoker, non-smoker) and mortality risk among patients diagnosed with COPD. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which was linked to mortality data from the National Death Index (NDI). Survival probabilities were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the associations between smoking status and mortality risk were quantified by using hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs derived from univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. In the multivariate models, we adjusted for sex, age, marital status, heart condition, drinking status, body mass index, and health status. <b>Results:</b> The multivariate model revealed a significantly higher mortality risk for former smokers (HR 1.619, 95% CI 1.198-2.188) and current smokers (HR 1.894, 95% CI 1.386-2.590) compared with non-smokers. Marital status significantly modified the smoking status-mortality relationship in adults with COPD (<i>P</i> = .01), with single/never married former smokers exhibiting the highest mortality risk (HR 3.711, 95% CI 1.130-12.187). <b>Conclusions:</b> Both current and former smoking statuses are associated with an increased mortality risk in adults with COPD. These findings underscore the critical impact of smoking on mortality risk among adults with COPD and highlight the significant modifying effect of marital status.",pubmed

Studies comparing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) prevalence across altitudes report conflicting results. However, household air pollution (HAP), a major COPD risk factor, was mostly not accounted for in previous analyses and never objectively measured. We aimed to compare the prevalence of COPD and its risk factors between low-resource highlands and lowlands, with a particular focus on objectively measured HAP.We conducted a population-based, observational study in a highland (∼2050 m above sea level) and a lowland (∼750 m above sea level) setting in rural Kyrgyzstan. We performed spirometry in randomly selected households, measured indoor particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 µm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and administered a questionnaire on other COPD risk factors. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regressions were used for analyses.We included 392 participants: 199 highlanders and 193 lowlanders. COPD was more prevalent among highlanders (36.7% <i>versus</i> 10.4%; p<0.001). Their average PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure was also higher (290.0 <i>versus</i> 72.0 µg·m<sup>-3</sup>; p<0.001).

We used linked Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) primary care and Office for National Statistics mortality data to identify adults with asthma and COPD from 2005 to 2015. Causes of death were ascertained using death certificates. Hazard ratios (HR) and excess risk of death were estimated using Fine-Gray competing risk models and adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, body mass index and socioeconomic status. 65,021 people with asthma and 45,649 with COPD in the CPRD dataset were frequency matched 5:1 with people without the disease on age, sex and general practice. Only 14 in 100,000 people with asthma are predicted to experience a respiratory-related death up to 10 years post-diagnosis, whereas in COPD this is 98 in 100,000. Asthma is associated with an 0.01% excess incidence of respiratory related mortality whereas COPD is associated with an 0.07% excess. Among people with asthma-COPD overlap (N = 22,145) we observed an increased risk of respiratory-related death compared to those with asthma alone (HR = 1.30; 95% CI 1.21-1.40) but not COPD alone (HR = 0.89; 95% CI 0.83-0.94).

The most effective way to halt the advancement of COPD is smoking cessation. However, limited data are available on the question of whether quitting smoking within two years after COPD diagnosis reduces the risk of mortality. The goal of our research was to analyze the relationship between quitting smoking after COPD diagnosis and the risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality, using the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database. This study included 1,740 male COPD patients aged 40 years or more who had been newly diagnosed within the 2003-2014 time period and had smoked prior to their COPD diagnosis. The patients were categorized into two groups according to their smoking status after COPD diagnosis: (i) persistent smokers (ii) quitters (smoking cessation within two years of COPD diagnosis). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to determine the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for both all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Among 1,740 patients (mean age, 64.6 years; mean follow-up duration, 7.6 years), 30.5% stopped smoking after COPD diagnosis. Quitters gained a 17% risk reduction in all-cause mortality (aHR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69-1.00) and a 44% risk reduction in cardiovascular mortality (aHR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.95) compared with persistent smokers.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has a significant impact on healthcare systems and health-related quality of life. Increased prevalence of smoking is an important factor contributing to high burden of COPD in the Middle East and Africa (MEA). Several other factors including sedentary lifestyle, urbanization, second-hand smoke, air pollution, and occupational exposure are also responsible for the upsurge of COPD in the MEA. Frequent COPD exacerbations accelerate disease progression, progressively deteriorate the lung function, and negatively affect quality of life. This consensus is based on review of the published evidence, international and regional guidelines, and insights provided by the expert committee members from the MEA region. Spirometry, though the gold standard for diagnosis, is often unavailable and/or underutilized leading to underdiagnosis of COPD in primary care settings. Low adherence to the treatment guidelines and delayed use of appropriate combination therapy including triple therapy are additional barriers in management of COPD in MEA. It is necessary to recognize COPD as a screenable condition and develop easy and simple screening tools to facilitate early diagnosis. Knowledge of the disease symptomatology at patient and physician level and adherence to the international or regional guidelines are important to create awareness about harmful effects of smoking and develop national guidelines to focus on prevention on COPD. Implementation of vaccination program and pulmonary rehabilitation are equally valuable to manage patients with COPD at local and regional level.

Participants completed a questionnaire aiming to diagnose CB. The overall prevalence was 9.9% for COPD; 7.4% for CB. Participants were predominantly smokers; 73.2% active smokers, 91.8% active or former smokers. The prevalence of COPD was high, especially among those under 40 years of age. Both COPD and CB were associated with smoking status. This study among Greenlandic seafood workers found that smoking was a risk factor for COPD and CB among Greenlanders of Inuit origin.

Several major risk factors for COPD, such as population ageing, smoking rates and air pollution levels, are rapidly changing, causing inevitable changes in the population burden of COPD. We determined the excess direct costs of COPD and their trend from 2001 to 2020. Using administrative health data from British Columbia, Canada, we created a retrospective matched cohort of physician-diagnosed COPD patients and non-COPD individuals. Excess direct medical costs (in 2020 Canadian dollars (CAD)) were estimated by analysing hospital records, outpatient services, medications and community care services. Comorbidity classes were assessed using International Classification of Diseases codes. Excess COPD costs were estimated as the adjusted difference in direct medical costs between the COPD and non-COPD cohorts. There were 208 554 and 404 703 individuals in the COPD and non-COPD cohorts, respectively (47.8% female; mean baseline age 69.1 and 68.2 years, respectively). Direct medical costs for COPD were CAD 9224 per patient-year compared to CAD 3396 per patient-year for non-COPD, giving rise to excess costs of CAD 5828 (95% CI 5759-5897) per patient-year. Excess costs increased by 48% over the study period.

Chronic exposure to indoor biomass smoke from the combustion of solid organic fuels is a major cause of disease burden worldwide. Almost 3 billion people use solid fuels such as wood, charcoal, and crop residues for indoor cooking and heating, accounting for approximately 50% of all households and 90% of rural households globally. Biomass smoke contains many hazardous pollutants, resulting in household air pollution (HAP) exposure that often exceeds international standards. Long-term biomass-smoke exposure is associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in adults, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, chronic bronchitis, and other lung conditions. Biomass smoke-associated COPD differs from the best-known cigarette smoke-induced COPD in several aspects, such as a slower decline in lung function, greater airway involvement, and less emphysema, which suggests a different phenotype and pathophysiology. Despite the high burden of biomass-associated COPD, the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are poorly understood.

The Nurses' Health Study (N = 86,711) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (N = 39,817) data was used to develop a COPD risk prediction model. Data was randomly split in 50-50 samples for model building and validation. Cox regression with time-varying covariates was used to assess the association between smoking duration, intensity and year-since-quit and self-reported COPD diagnosis incidence. We evaluated the model calibration as well as discriminatory accuracy via the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC). We computed 6-year risk of COPD incidence given various individual smoking scenarios. Smoking duration, year-since-quit (if former smokers), sex, and interaction of sex and smoking duration are significantly associated with the incidence of diagnosed COPD.

This review covers the epidemiology and burden of COPD in LMICs, and challenges and recommendations related to health-care systems, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Main challenges are related to under-resourced health-care systems (such as limited availability of spirometry, rehabilitation, and medicines). Lack of policy and practical local guidelines on COPD diagnosis and management further contribute to the low diagnostic and treatment rates. In the absence of, or limited number of respiratory specialists, primary care practitioners (general practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, and community health workers) play an even more pivotal role in COPD management in LMICs.

Respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD)and asthma, are becoming increasingly prevalent in super-aging societies. In Japan, the estimated prevalence of COPD among individuals aged 40 years and above is 8.6%, while asthma affects about 10% of adults. These statistics highlight the similarities between COPD and asthma in clinical settings. Both diseases involve chronic airway inflammation and present with symptoms such as chronic cough, sputum production, wheezing, and dyspnea. Exacerbations of these symptoms and complications are critical concerns during the perioperative period. COPD, often caused by long-term smoking, leads to irreversible airway and lung damage, while asthma is characterized by episodic and reversible airway constriction due to chronic inflammation. COPD diagnosis involves spirometry and the exclusion of other diseases, with treatment goals focusing on symptom improvement and risk reduction through smoking cessation, pharmacotherapy(mainly bronchodilators), and non-pharmacological methods(such as pulmonary rehabilitation). Asthma management aims to control inflammation and prevent exacerbations using inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators as standard treatments. Perioperative management of both diseases involves improving respiratory function with pharmacotherapy, careful anesthesia selection, and early postoperative mobilization. Consultation with respiratory specialists is recommended for effective management, especially in complex cases.",pubmed

Additional summary statistics for COPD were obtained from 193,638 individuals of European ancestry in the GWAS published by FinnGen. Univariable Mendelian randomization(UVMR) analysis was performed using inverse variance weighted (IVW) as the primary method of analysis. The reliability of the results was verified by multivariable MR(MVMR), reverse and replication MR analysis, and sensitivity analysis. In the UVMR analysis, asthma increased the risk of COPD, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.16-1.39, P = 5.44×10-7). Estimates were consistent in MVMR analyses by the adjustments of smoking initiation, age of smoking initiation, cigarettes per day, PM 2.5, and the combination of the above factors. In the reverse MR analysis, there was no evidence of a causal effect of COPD on asthma risk(OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.97-1.07, P = 0.3643). In the replication MR analysis, asthma still increased the risk of COPD. Sensitivity analyses validated the robustness of the above associations. We found that genetically predicted asthma was positively associated with the risk of COPD. Additionally, there was no evidence that COPD increases the risk of asthma. Further clarification of this link and underlying mechanisms is needed to identify feasible measures to promote COPD prevention.",pubmed

Blast lung overpressure has received interest as a cause of chronic respiratory disease in Service members who deployed in support of U.S. military operations in Southwest Asia and Afghanistan since 2001. We studied whether veterans who experienced blast exposure report more chronic respiratory symptoms and diagnoses compared to deployed veterans who did not. 9,000 veterans included in the Department of Veterans Affairs Toxic Embedded Fragment Registry were invited to complete a survey assessing chronic respiratory symptoms, diagnoses, and exposures. Blast exposure was assessed using the Brief Traumatic Brain Injury Screen and by presence of other symptoms such as blast-induced loss of consciousness. Participants (n = 2147) were predominantly <40 years old, served in the Army, and injured on average 12.8 years previously. 91% reported blast exposure. Blast-exposed veterans were significantly more likely to report cough (OR 1.8), wheeze (OR 2.4), and dyspnea (OR 1.8), even after adjustment for covariates including smoking and occupational exposures to dust, fume, and gas. Veterans reporting higher severity of blast impact, such as traumatic brain injury or loss of consciousness, were more likely to report cough, wheeze, or dyspnea. Veterans with higher severity of blast impact by multiple measures were also more likely to report having COPD. Those reporting a physician-diagnosis of traumatic brain injury were significantly more likely to report having both asthma (OR 1.5) and COPD (OR 1.5). Blast exposure is associated with respiratory symptoms and COPD. Respiratory system evaluation may warrant inclusion as a standard part of barotrauma health assessment.",pubmed

COPD is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and results in increased healthcare costs and disability. Smoking is the main determinant of COPD development and continued use increases mortality as compared to those who have stopped smoking. Research has indicated that cigarette smoking may play a role in attempts to regulate distressing emotional experiences and thus, may be an important transdiagnostic process underlying continued smoking behavior among adults with COPD. The current study investigated the role of ER difficulties in relation to smoking status and cigarettes smoked per day among adults with COPD. This cross-sectional study included a sample was adults with COPD (N = 320). Participants self-reported current smoking status, daily smoking, and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, probable depression, probable anxiety, and dyspnea severity. DERS total scores were associated with greater odds of current smoking. With the exception of impulsivity, all other dimensions of emotion regulation were significantly associated with current smoking. Greater difficulties in emotional awareness were associated with greater cigarettes smoked per day. However, neither the DERS total score nor any other dimensions of emotional regulation were significantly associated with cigarettes smoked per day. The present study provides preliminary data linking ER difficulties to smoking behavior among adults with COPD. If corroborated by future research, these findings suggest that ER might be a potential target for smoking cessation programs among adults with COPD.",pubmed

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common public health problem worldwide. Recent studies have reported that socioeconomic status (SES) is related to the incidence of COPD. This study aimed to investigate the association between SES and COPD among adults in Jiangsu province, China, and to determine the possible direct and indirect effects of SES on the morbidity of COPD. A cross-sectional study was conducted among adults aged 40 years and above between May and December of 2015 in Jiangsu province, China. Participants were selected using a multistage sampling approach. COPD, the outcome variable, was diagnosed by physicians based on spirometry, respiratory symptoms, and risk factors. Education, occupation, and monthly family average income (FAI) were used to separately indicate SES as the explanatory variable. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were introduced to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for examining the SES-COPD relationship. A pathway analysis was conducted to further explore the pulmonary function impairment of patients with different SES. The mean age of the 2421 participants was 56.63 ± 9.62 years. The prevalence of COPD was 11.8% (95% CI: 10.5%-13.1%) among the overall sample population. After adjustment for age, gender, residence, outdoor and indoor air pollution, body weight status, cigarette smoking, and potential study area-level clustering effects, educational attainment was negatively associated with COPD prevalence in men; white collars were at lower risk (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.43-0.83) of experiencing COPD than blue collars; compared with those within the lower FAI subgroup, participants in the upper (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49-0.97) tertiles were less likely to experience COPD. Such negative associations between all these three SES indicators and COPD were significant among men only. Education, FAI, and occupation had direct or indirect effects on pulmonary function including post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC), FEV1, FVC, and FEV1 percentage of predicted. Education, FAI, and occupation had indirect effects on pulmonary function indices of all participants mainly through smoking status, indoor air pollution, and outdoor air pollution. We also found that occupation could affect post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC through body mass index. Education, occupation, and FAI had an adverse relationship with COPD prevalence in Jiangsu province, China. SES has both direct and indirect associations with pulmonary function impairment. SES is of great significance for COPD morbidity. It is important that population-based COPD prevention strategies should be tailored for people with different SES.",pubmed

Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) in patients with pulmonary diseases remain to be resolved clinical issue. However, most evidence regarding PPC has been established more than 10 years ago. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate perioperative management using new inhalant drugs in patients with obstructive pulmonary diseases. April 2014 through March 2015, 346 adult patients with pulmonary diseases (257 asthma, 89 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) underwent non-pulmonary surgery except cataract surgery in our university hospital. To analyze the risk factors for PPC, we retrospectively evaluated physiological backgrounds, surgical factors and perioperative specific treatment for asthma and COPD. Finally, 29 patients with pulmonary diseases (22 asthma, 7 COPD) had PPC. In patients with asthma, smoking index (≥ 20 pack-years), peripheral blood eosinophil count (≥ 200/mm<sup>3</sup>) and severity (Global INitiative for Asthma(GINA) STEP ≥ 3) were significantly associated with PPC in the multivariate logistic regression analysis [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 5.4(1.4-20.8), 0.31 (0.11-0.84) and 3.2 (1.04-9.9), respectively].

The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship of smoking duration with respiratory symptoms and history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the South Carolina Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey in 2012. Data from 4,135 adults aged ≥45 years with a smoking history were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression that accounted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, and current smoking status, as well as the complex sampling design. The distribution of smoking duration ranged from 19.2% (1-9 years) to 36.2% (≥30 years). Among 1,454 respondents who had smoked for ≥30 years, 58.3% were current smokers, 25.0% had frequent productive cough, 11.2% had frequent shortness of breath, 16.7% strongly agreed that shortness of breath affected physical activity, and 25.6% had been diagnosed with COPD. Prevalence of COPD and each respiratory symptom was lower among former smokers who quit ≥10 years earlier compared with current smokers. Smoking duration had a linear relationship with COPD (P<0.001) and all three respiratory symptoms (P<0.001) after adjusting for smoking status and other covariates. While COPD prevalence increased with prolonged smoking duration in both men and women, women had a higher age-adjusted prevalence of COPD in the 1-9 years, 20-29 years, and ≥30 years duration periods.

The secondary objective was to assess the stability of TTs and the effect of management advice on changes in traits and health outcomes. Data from the Dutch asthma/COPD service (2007-2023) were studied retrospectively. Patients ≥18 years with asthma, COPD, or Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) were included. The prevalence of eight TTs were assessed: 1) insufficient inhaler technique, 2) poor medication adherence, 3) blood eosinophilia, 4) smoking, 5) obesity, 6) physical inactivity, 7) reversible airflow limitation, and 8) anxiety and/or depression. The effect of management advice on TTs was evaluated for patients with a follow-up visit scheduled within 1-2 years. In total, 15246 patients (COPD n=4822; ACO n=1761, asthma n=8663) were included. The highest proportions of TTs were insufficient inhaler technique: 43.6% (95% CI: 42.9-44.4), followed by poor medication adherence: 40.3% (95% CI: 39.2-41.4) and blood eosinophilia: 36.9% (95% CI: 35.8-38.1).

To determine whether chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a risk factor for hip fracture and identify other factors associated with hip fracture. Observational nested case-control study was conducted in Aragon, Spain in 2010. We included COPD patients aged >40 years, in the EpiChron cohort. Each COPD patient was matched for age, sex, and number of comorbidities with a control subject without COPD. Patients with an existing diagnosis of osteoporosis and those with hip fracture before 2011 were excluded. We collected baseline demographic, comorbidity, and pharmacological treatment data. During a 5-year follow-up period, we recorded the incidence of hip fracture. A logistic regression model was constructed to identify factors associated with hip fracture. The study population consisted of 26,517 COPD patients and the same number of controls (median [interquartile range] age, 74 [17] years; women, 24.7%). Smoking and heart failure were more frequent in COPD patients, and obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, stroke, arthritis, and visual or hearing impairment were less frequent (all p<0.001). Consumption of benzodiazepines (p=0.037), bronchodilators (p<0.001), and corticosteroids (p<0.001) was higher in the COPD group, while that of beta-blockers and thiazides was lower (both p<0.001). During follow-up, 898 (1.7%) patients experienced hip fracture, with no differences observed between COPD and control patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that independent of COPD status, age, female sex, chronic liver disease, heart failure, and benzodiazepine use were independently associated with a higher risk of hip fracture, and obesity with a lower risk. In COPD patients, use of inhaled anticholinergics was independently associated with hip fracture (OR, 1.390; 95% CI 1.134-1.702; p=0.001). COPD is not a risk factor for a hip fracture within 5 years.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, closely related to smoking, are major lung diseases affecting millions of individuals worldwide. The generated gas mixture of smoking is proved to contain about 4,500 components such as carbon monoxide, nicotine, oxidants, fine particulate matter, and aldehydes. These components were considered to be the principle factor driving the pathogenesis and progression of pulmonary disease. A large proportion of lung cancer patients showed a history of COPD, which demonstrated that there might be a close relationship between COPD and lung cancer. In the early stages of smoking, lung barrier provoked protective response and DNA repair are likely to suppress these changes to a certain extent. In the presence of long-term smoking exposure, these mechanisms seem to be malfunctioned and lead to disease progression. The infiltration of inflammatory cells to mucosa, submucosa, and glandular tissue caused by inhaled cigarette smoke is responsible for the destruction of matrix, blood supply shortage, and epithelial cell death. Conversely, cancer cells have the capacity to modulate the proliferation of epithelial cells and produce of new vascular networks. Comprehension understanding of mechanisms responsible for both pathologies is necessary for the prevention and treatment of COPD and lung cancer.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent condition in adults aged ≥40 years characterized by progressive airflow limitation associated with chronic inflammatory response to noxious particles in the airways and lungs. Smoking, genetics, air pollution, nutrition and other factors may influence COPD development. Most hospitalizations and deaths for COPD are caused by its acute exacerbations, which greatly affect the health and quality of life of COPD patients and pose a high burden on health services. The aims of this project were to identify trends, geographic patterns and risk factors for COPD exacerbations, as revealed by hospitalizations and deaths, in the Basque Country, Spain, over a period of 12 years (2000-2011). Hospitalization and mortality rates for COPD were 262 and 18 per 100,000 population, respectively, with clusters around the biggest cities. Hospital mortality was 7.4%. Most hospitalized patients were male (77.4%) and accounted for 72.1% of hospital mortality. Hospitalizations decreased during the study period, except for 50-64 year-old women, peaking significantly. Using a multivariate modeling approach it was shown that hospitalizations were positively correlated with increased atmospheric concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, PM<sub>10</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub>, and increased influenza incidence, but were negatively associated with increased temperatures and atmospheric O<sub>3</sub> concentration. COPD exacerbations decreased in the Basque Country during 2000-2011, but not among 50-64-year-old women, reflecting the high smoking prevalence among Spanish women during the 1970-1990s. The main metropolitan areas were those with the highest risk for COPD exacerbations, calling attention to the role of heavy car traffic. Influenza virus, cold temperatures, and increased atmospheric NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, PM<sub>10</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> (but decreased O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations were identified as potential contributors to the burden of COPD exacerbations in the community.

Fish and n-3 PUFAs are an important component of the prudent dietary pattern that is thought to be protective in the onset of COPD. We examined the role of fish and PUFA intakes on risk of developing COPD while taking into account the overall dietary pattern. We investigated the objective in 120,175 women and men from the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Over the study period (1984-2000), there were 889 cases of newly diagnosed COPD. Cumulative average intakes of fish, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, n-3 PUFAs, n-6 PUFAs, and the n-3:n-6 ratio were calculated from repeated food-frequency questionnaires. Because fish is a food group included in the prudent pattern, we derived a new prudent pattern without the contribution from fish, and we termed this pattern the ""modified prudent"" pattern. We performed multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Before the dietary pattern was taken into account, and with 14 factors controlled for, we showed that more-frequent fish intake (≥4 servings/wk) was inversely associated with risk of COPD [adjusted pooled HR for the highest intake compared with the lowest intake (<1 serving/wk): 0.71; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.94]. After additional adjustment for the dietary pattern (modified prudent and Western patterns), the association was NS (0.84; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.13).

With rising obesity rates, understanding its effects on respiratory health is increasingly essential. We aimed to evaluate IOS parameters as predictors of respiratory dysfunction across different BMI categories, offering insights into managing complex cases involving obesity and lung disease. We retrospectively analyzed IOS data from 1,947 patients referred to a secondary care allergy and lung clinic. IOS parameters assessed included total and peripheral airway resistance (R<sub>5</sub> and R<sub>5-20</sub>), resonant frequency (Fres), and reactance area (A<sub>X</sub>), examined relative to BMI. The cohort included patients with asthma, COPD, other lung diseases, and controls. A weighted random forest model was used to assess the impact of IOS parameters on BMI prediction accuracy, adjusting for imbalances in BMI and disease groups. Obesity significantly affected IOS parameters, with R<sub>5-20</sub>, A<sub>X</sub>, and Fres emerging as key markers across all diagnostic groups. Elevated R<sub>5-20</sub>, A<sub>X</sub> and Fres values in obese patients, regardless of lung disease status, indicated increased small airway resistance and dysfunction. These IOS features demonstrated high predictive value in BMI-related outcomes, suggesting they capture airway impairments tied to obesity beyond conventional respiratory diagnoses.

Chronic phlegm was associated with significantly higher prevalence of cognitive impairment in models adjusted for age, sex, marital status, geographic region, urban/rural, education, smoking status, alcohol drinking, and indoor air pollution (odds ratio [OR] 1.46, 95% CI 1.11, 1.93). Chronic respiratory symptoms and self-reported COPD were strongly related to cognitive impairment in urban areas. There were no significant effect modifications for sex, regions, educational level, smoking status, and alcohol drinking. There was strong association between COPD and cognitive impairment in urban Chinese elderly population.",pubmed

Limited evidence suggests that exposure to maternal smoking in utero or early life might be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but whether this is independent of later own smoking remains unclear. Our objective was to examine the independent and combined association of maternal and own smoking with adult lung function and COPD. We used UK Biobank to examine associations of maternal smoking around delivery, and pack-years of own smoking, with lung function (n = 502 626) and hospitalization/death from COPD (n = 433 863). We calculated the additive interaction between maternal and own smoking on the outcomes of interest, and estimated the association with maternal smoking within categories of own smoking. There was no strong evidence that maternal smoking influenced adult lung health among never smokers. Exposure to both maternal and own smoking was associated with lower Forced expiratory volume (FEV1)/ forced vital capacity (FVC) and greater risk of hospitalization/death from COPD than expected from their independent associations. For FEV1/FVC, the mean difference according to maternal smoking was -0.02 (-0.06, 0.02), -0.01 (-0.05, 0.03), -0.11 (-0.16, -0.05) and -0.11 (-0.19, -0.04) among women who smoked ≤10, 11-20, 21-30 and >30 pack-years, respectively. The association between maternal smoking and COPD also varied by pack-years of own smoking, with a hazard ratio of 2.25 (1.30, 3.89) for ≤10 years, 1.23 (0.80, 1.89) for 11-20 years, 1.30 (0.85, 2.01) for 21-30 years and 1.14 (0.91, 1.43) for >30 years. Our findings indicate an excess reduction in FEV1/FVC and risk of COPD due to maternal smoking that is heterogeneous across levels of own smoking.",pubmed
respiratory_33191816,33191816,respiratory,2021.0,"COPD in Biomass exposed nonsmokers: a different phenotype.. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, most commonly caused by tobacco smoking, is increasingly reported in nonsmoking patients exposed to domestic combustion of biomass fuels. This is particularly common among rural women in the low- and middle-income countries. It is highly likely that the disease in these patients is a different clinical phenotype. This manuscript covers epidemiological and clinical aspects of biomass-exposed COPD and also dwells upon its different phenotypic characteristics. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in biomass-exposed, nonsmoker patients which predominantly presents with features of chronic bronchitis is more likely a distinct phenotype with greater likelihood of small airway involvement.",pubmed
respiratory_31012388,31012388,respiratory,2019.0,"Computational modeling of lung deposition of inhaled particles in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients: identification of gaps in knowledge and data.. Computational modeling together with experimental data are essential to assess the risk for particulate matter mediated lung toxicity and to predict the efficacy, safety and fate of aerosolized drug molecules used in inhalation therapy. <i>In silico</i> models are widely used to understand the deposition, distribution, and clearance of inhaled particles and aerosols in the human lung. Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been reported due to increased particulate matter related air pollution episodes. Considering the profound functional, anatomical and structural changes occurring in COPD lungs, the relevance of the existing <i>in silico</i> models for mimicking diseased lungs warrants reevaluation. Currently available computational modeling tools were developed for the healthy adult (male) lung. Here, we analyze the major alterations occurring in the airway structure, anatomy and pulmonary function in the COPD lung, as compared to the healthy lung. We also scrutinize the various physiological and particle characteristics that influence particle deposition, distribution and clearance in the lung. The aim of this review is to evaluate the availability of the fundamental knowledge and data required for modeling particle deposition in a COPD lung departing from the existing healthy lung models. The extent to which COPD pathophysiology may affect aerosol deposition depends on the relative contribution of several factors such as altered lung structure and function, bronchoconstriction, emphysema, loss of elastic recoil, altered breathing pattern and altered liquid volumes that warrant consideration while developing physiologically relevant <i>in silico</i> models.",pubmed

We aimed to clarify the association between air pollution and hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and mortality in Beijing, China. In this retrospective study, we recruited 510 COPD patients from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2009. The patient data were obtained from the electronic medical records of Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing. Air pollution and meteorological data were obtained from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Monthly COPD hospital admissions, mortality and air pollution data were analysed using Poisson regression in generalised additive models adjusted for mean temperature, pressure and relative humidity. There were positive correlations between sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub> ), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm (PM<sub>10</sub> ) and COPD hospital admissions in the single-pollutant model. An increase of 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> in SO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> were associated with an increase of 4.053% (95% CI: 1.470-5.179%) and 1.401% (95%CI: 0.6656-1.850%) in COPD hospital admissions. In the multiple-pollutant model [SO<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub> ) combinations], there was only a positive correlation between SO<sub>2</sub> and COPD hospital admissions. An increase of 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> in SO<sub>2</sub> were associated with an increase of 1.916% (95% CI: 1.118-4.286%) in COPD hospital admissions. There was no correlation between three pollutant combinations and COPD hospital admissions. We did not find correlations between air pollution and COPD mortality in either single- or multiple-pollutant models. SO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> may be important factors for the increase in COPD hospital admissions in Beijing, China.",pubmed
respiratory_30923493,30923493,respiratory,2019.0,"Effects of Aging and Smoking Duration on Cigarette Smoke-Induced COPD Severity.. Aging can serve as an underlying mechanism of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Also, smoking, which is the most common cause of COPD, is responsible for the systemic manifestations of the disease, independently from the lung function alterations. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of aging on the occurrence of cigarette smoking induced COPD. For this analysis, we evaluated smoking status by a lifestyle intervention program and measured the occurrence of COPD by the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) from 2005 to 2015. Aging and smoking were significantly effected on the lung function of COPD patients. Especially, the smoking duration is exaggerated in the presence of old age for older COPD patients. The result showed that COPD patients exhibit aging and smoking duration related severity. The prevalence of COPD kept increasing internationally. Knowing the risk factor of COPD quantitatively and finding out the interaction among risk factors could be valuable predictors for preventing COPD.",pubmed

All the local people aged 30-79 years were asked to receive questionnaire survey, physical examination and pulmonary function testing. FEV<sub>1</sub>max/FVC max≤0.7 was the criterion of COPD diagnosis. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between smoking/indoor air pollution and COPD, multiplied interaction between smoking and indoor air pollution was evaluated, Excel table prepared by Andersson et al. was used to calculate the adding interaction. <b>Results:</b> The overall prevalence of COPD was 6.6%, and adjusted for age, educational level, occupation, marriage, income level, BMI, waist-to-hip and other factors, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that males who had quit smoking, started smoking at age of <25 years had a high risk of COPD; females who smoked every day <15 g, inhaled smoke into mouth or throat had high risk of COPD. Interaction analysis showed that using fuel of firewood/charcoal/coal, briquettes for cooking and regular smoking had multiplied interaction on COPD. Use no chimney or exhaust system in cooking and regular smoking had adding interaction in females. <b>Conclusion:</b> The prevalence of COPD in Tongxiang was close to the national average level. Female smokers had higher risk for COPD than male smokers. Improving kitchen ventilation, using natural gas or fuel gas for cooking and active tobacco control would facilitate the prevention of COPD.",pubmed
